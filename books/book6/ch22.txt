Chapter 22: After the Burial


Patch­es of bright blue sky were be­gin­ning to ap­pear over the cas­tle tur­rets, but these signs of ap­proach­ing sum­mer did not lift Har­ry’s mood. He had been thwart­ed, both in his at­tempts to find out what Mal­foy was do­ing, and in his ef­forts to start a con­ver­sa­tion with Slughorn that might lead, some­how, to Slughorn hand­ing over the mem­ory he had ap­par­ent­ly sup­pressed for decades.

“For the last time, just for­get about Mal­foy,” Hermione told Har­ry firm­ly.

They were sit­ting with Ron in a sun­ny cor­ner of the court­yard af­ter lunch. Hermione and Ron were both clutch­ing a Min­istry of Mag­ic leaflet — Com­mon Ap­pari­tion Mis­takes and How to Avoid Them — for they were tak­ing their tests that very af­ter­noon, but by and large the leaflets had not proved sooth­ing to the nerves.

Ron gave a start and tried to hide be­hind Hermione as a girl came around the cor­ner.

“It isn’t Laven­der,” said Hermione weari­ly.

“Oh, good,” said Ron, re­lax­ing.

“Har­ry Pot­ter?” said the girl. “I was asked to give you this.”

“Thanks…”

Har­ry’s heart sank as he took the small scroll of parch­ment. Once the girl was out of earshot he said, “Dum­ble­dore said we wouldn’t be hav­ing any more lessons un­til I got the mem­ory!”

“Maybe he wants to check on how you’re do­ing?” sug­gest­ed Hermione, as Har­ry un­rolled the parch­ment; but rather than find­ing Dum­ble­dore’s long, nar­row, slant­ed writ­ing he saw an un­tidy sprawl, very dif­fi­cult to read due to the pres­ence of large blotch­es on the parch­ment where the ink had run.

Dear Har­ry, Ron and Hermione! Ar­agog died last night. Har­ry and Ron, you met him and you know how spe­cial he was. Hermione, I know you’d have liked him. It would mean a lot to me if you’d nip down for the buri­al lat­er this evening. I’m plan­ning on do­ing it round dusk, that was his fa­vorite time of day. I know you’re not sup­posed to be out that late, but you can use the cloak. Wouldn’t ask, but I can’t face it alone. Ha­grid

“Look at this,” said Har­ry, hand­ing the note to Hermione. “Oh, for heav­en’s sake,” she said, scan­ning it quick­ly and pass­ing it to Ron, who read it through look­ing in­creas­ing­ly in­cred­ulous. “He’s men­tal” he said fu­ri­ous­ly. “That thing told its mates to eat Har­ry and me! Told them to help them­selves! And now Ha­grid ex­pects us to go down there and cry over its hor­ri­ble hairy body!”

“Its not just that,” said Hermione. “He’s ask­ing us to leave the cas­tle at night and he knows se­cu­ri­ty’s a mil­li­on times tighter and how much trou­ble we’d be in if we were caught.”

“We’ve been down to see him by night be­fore,” said Har­ry.

“Yes, but for some­thing like this?” said Hermione. “We’ve risked a lot to help Ha­grid out, but af­ter all — Ar­agog’s dead. If it were a ques­tion of sav­ing him —”

“— I’d want to go even less,” said Ron firm­ly. “You didn’t meet him, Hermione. Be­lieve me, be­ing dead will have im­proved him a lot.”

Har­ry took the note back and stared down at all the inky blotch­es all over it. Tears had clear­ly fall­en thick and fast up­on the parch­ment. . . .

“Har­ry, you can’t be think­ing of go­ing,” said Hermione. “It’s such a point­less thing to get de­ten­tion for.”

Har­ry sighed. “Yeah, I know,” he said. “I s’pose Ha­grid’ll have to bury Ar­agog with­out us.”

“Yes, he will,” said Hermione, look­ing re­lieved. “Look, Po­tions will be al­most emp­ty this af­ter­noon, with us all off do­ing our tests. . . . Try and soft­en Slughorn up a bit then!”

“Fifty­sev­enth time lucky, you think?” said Har­ry bit­ter­ly.

“Lucky,” said Ron sud­den­ly. “Har­ry, that’s it — get lucky!”

“What d’you mean?”

“Use your lucky po­tion!”

“Ron, that’s — that’s it!” said Hermione, sound­ing stunned. “Of course! Why didn’t I think of it?”

Har­ry stared at them both. “Fe­lix Fe­li­cis?” he said. “I dun­no . . . I was sort of sav­ing it. …”

“What for?” de­mand­ed Ron in­cred­ulous­ly.

“What on earth is more im­por­tant than this mem­ory, Har­ry?” asked Hermione.

Har­ry did not an­swer. The thought of that lit­tle gold­en bot­tle had hov­ered on the edges of his imag­ina­tion for some time; vague and un­for­mu­lat­ed plans that in­volved Gin­ny split­ting up with Dean, and Ron some­how be­ing hap­py to see her with a new boyfriend, had been fer­ment­ing in the depths of his brain, un­ac­knowl­edged ex­cept dur­ing dreams or the twi­light time be­tween sleep­ing and wak­ing. . . .

“Har­ry? Are you still with us?” asked Hermione.

“Wha — ? Yeah, of course,” he said, pulling him­self to­geth­er. “Well. . . okay. If I can’t get Slughorn to talk this af­ter­noon, I’ll take some Fe­lix and have an­oth­er go this evening.”

“That’s de­cid­ed, then,” said Hermione briskly, get­ting to her feet and per­form­ing a grace­ful pirou­ette. “Des­ti­na­tion . . . de­ter­mi­na­tion . . . de­lib­er­ation . . .” she mur­mured.

“Oh, stop that,” Ron begged her, “I feel sick enough as it is — quick, hide me!”

“It isn’t Laven­der!” said Hermione im­pa­tient­ly, as an­oth­er cou­ple of girls ap­peared in the court­yard and Ron dived be­hind her.

“Cool,” said Ron, peer­ing over Hermiones shoul­der to check. “Blimey, they don’t look hap­py, do they?”

“They’re the Mont­gomery sis­ters and of course they don’t look hap­py, didn’t you hear what hap­pened to their lit­tle broth­er?” said Hermione.

“I’m los­ing track of what’s hap­pen­ing to ev­ery­one’s rel­atives, to be hon­est,” said Ron.

“Well, their broth­er was at­tacked by a were­wolf. The ru­mor is that their moth­er re­fused to help the Death Eaters. Any­way, the boy was on­ly five and he died in St. Mun­gos, they couldn’t save him.”

“He died?” re­peat­ed Har­ry, shocked. “But sure­ly were­wolves don’t kill, they just turn you in­to one of them?”

“They some­times kill,” said Ron, who looked un­usu­al­ly grave now. “I’ve heard of it hap­pen­ing when the were­wolf gets car­ried away.”

“What was the were­wolf’s name?” said Har­ry quick­ly.

“Well, the ru­mor is that it was that Fen­rir Grey­back,” said Hermione.

“I knew it — the ma­ni­ac who likes at­tack­ing kids, the one Lupin told me about!” said Har­ry an­gri­ly.

Hermione looked at him bleak­ly.

“Har­ry, you’ve got to get that mem­ory,” she said. “It’s all about stop­ping Volde­mort, isn’t it? These dread­ful things that are hap­pen­ing are all down to him. . . .”

The bell rang over­head in the cas­tle and both Hermione and Ron jumped to their feet, look­ing ter­ri­fied.

“You’ll do fine,” Har­ry told them both, as they head­ed to­ward the en­trance hall to meet the rest of the peo­ple tak­ing their Ap­pari­tion Test. “Good luck.”

“And you too!” said Hermione with a sig­nif­icant look, as Har­ry head­ed off to the dun­geons.

There were on­ly three of them in Po­tions that af­ter­noon: Har­ry, Ernie, and Dra­co Mal­foy.

“All too young to Ap­pa­rate just yet?” said Slughorh ge­nial­ly, “Not turned sev­en­teen yet?”

They shook their heads.

“Ah well,” said Slughorn cheer­ily, “as we’re so few, we’ll do some­thing for fun. I want you all to brew me up some­thing amus­ing!”

“That sounds good, sir,” said Ernie syco­phan­ti­cal­ly, rub­bing his hands to­geth­er. Mal­foy, on the oth­er hand, did not crack a smile. “What do you mean, ’some­thing amus­ing’?” he said ir­ri­ta­bly. “Oh, sur­prise me,” said Slughorn air­ily.

Mal­foy opened his copy of Ad­vanced Po­tion­Mak­ing with a sulky ex­pres­sion. It could not have been plain­er that he thought this les­son was a waste of time. Un­doubt­ed­ly, Har­ry thought, watch­ing him over the top of his own book, Mal­foy was be­grudg­ing the time he could oth­er­wise be spend­ing in the Room of Re­quire­ment.

Was it his imag­ina­tion, or did Mal­foy, like Tonks, look thin­ner! Cer­tain­ly he looked paler; his skin still had that gray­ish tinge, prob­ably be­cause he so rarely saw day­light these days. But there was no air of smug­ness, ex­cite­ment, or su­pe­ri­or­ity; none of the swag­ger that he had had on the Hog­warts Ex­press, when he had boast­ed open­ly of the mis­sion he had been giv­en by Volde­mort. . . . There could be on­ly one con­clu­sion, in Har­ry’s opin­ion: The mis­sion, what­ev­er it was, was go­ing bad­ly.

Cheered by this thought, Har­ry skimmed through his copy of Ad­vanced Po­tion­Mak­ing and found a heav­ily cor­rect­ed Half­Blood Prince’s ver­sion of “An Elixir to In­duce Eu­pho­ria,” which seemed not on­ly to meet Slughorn’s in­struc­tions, but which might (Har­ry’s heart leapt as the thought struck him) put Slughorn in­to such a good mood that he would be pre­pared to hand over that mem­ory if Har­ry could per­suade him to taste some. . . .

“Well, now, this looks ab­so­lute­ly won­der­ful,” said Slughorn an hour and a half lat­er, clap­ping his hands to­geth­er as he stared down in­to the sun­shine yel­low con­tents of Har­ry’s caul­dron. “Eu­pho­ria, I take it? And what’s that I smell? Mm­mm . . . you’ve added just a sprig of pep­per­mint, haven’t you? Un­or­tho­dox, but what a stroke of in­spi­ra­tion, Har­ry, of course, that would tend to coun­ter­bal­an­ce the oc­ca­sion­al side ef­fects of ex­ces­sive singing and nosetweak­ing. … I re­al­ly don’t know where you get these brain waves, my boy . . . un­less —”

Har­ry pushed the Half­Blood Prince’s book deep­er in­to his bag with his foot.

“— it’s just your moth­er’s genes com­ing out in you!”

“Oh . . . yeah, maybe,” said Har­ry, re­lieved.

Ernie was look­ing rather grumpy; de­ter­mined to out­shine Har­ry for once, he had most rash­ly in­vent­ed his own po­tion, which had cur­dled and formed a kind of pur­ple dumpling at the bot­tom of his caul­dron. Mal­foy was al­ready pack­ing up, sour­faced; Slughorn had pro­nounced his Hic­cup­ing So­lu­tion mere­ly “pass­able.”

The bell rang and both Ernie and Mal­foy left at once. “Sir,” Har­ry be­gan, but Slughorn im­me­di­ate­ly glanced over his shoul­der; when he saw that the room was emp­ty but for him­self and Har­ry, he hur­ried away as fast as he could.

“Pro­fes­sor — Pro­fes­sor, don’t you want to taste my po — ?” called Har­ry des­per­ate­ly.

But Slughorn had gone. Dis­ap­point­ed, Har­ry emp­tied the caul­dron, packed up his things, left the dun­geon, and walked slow­ly back up­stairs to the com­mon room.

Ron and Hermione re­turned in the late af­ter­noon.

“Har­ry!” cried Hermione as she climbed through the por­trait hole. “Har­ry, I passed!”

“Well done!” he said. “And Ron?”

“He — he just failed,” whis­pered Hermione, as Ron came slouch­ing in­to the room look­ing most mo­rose. “It was re­al­ly un­lucky, a tiny thing, the ex­am­in­er just spot­ted that he’d left half an eye­brow be­hind. . . How did it go with Slughorn?”

“No joy,” said Har­ry, as Ron joined them. “Bad luck, mate, but you’ll pass next time — we can take it to­geth­er.”

“Yeah, I s’pose,” said Ron grumpi­ly. “But half an eye­brow – like that mat­ters!”

“I know,” said Hermione sooth­ing­ly, “it does seem re­al­ly harsh. …”

They spent most of their din­ner round­ly abus­ing the Ap­pari­tion ex­am­in­er, and Ron looked frac­tion­al­ly more cheer­ful by the time they set off back to the com­mon room, now dis­cussing the con­tin­uing prob­lem of Slughorn and the mem­ory.

“So, Har­ry — you go­ing to use the Fe­lix Fe­li­cis or what?” Ron de­mand­ed.

“Yeah, I s’pose I’d bet­ter,” said Har­ry. “I don’t reck­on I’ll need all of it, not twen­ty­four hours’ worth, it can’t take all night…. I’ll just take a mouth­ful. Two or three hours should do it.”

“It’s a great feel­ing when you take it,” said Ron rem­inis­cent­ly. “Like you can’t do any­thing wrong.”

“What are you talk­ing about?” said Hermione, laugh­ing. “You’ve nev­er tak­en any!”

“Yeah, but I thought I had, didn’t I?” said Ron, as though ex­plain­ing the ob­vi­ous. “Same dif­fer­ence re­al­ly …”

As they had on­ly just seen Slughorn en­ter the Great Hall and knew that he liked to take time over meals, they lin­gered for a while in the com­mon room, the plan be­ing that Har­ry should go to Slughorn s of­fice once the teach­er had had time to get back there. When the sun had sunk to the lev­el of the tree­tops in the For­bid­den For­est, they de­cid­ed the mo­ment had come, and af­ter check­ing care­ful­ly that Neville, Dean, and Sea­mus were all in the com­mon room, sneaked up to the boys’ dor­mi­to­ry.

Har­ry took out the rolledup socks at the bot­tom of his trunk and ex­tract­ed the tiny, gleam­ing bot­tle.

“Well, here goes,” said Har­ry, and he raised the lit­tle bot­tle and look a care­ful­ly mea­sured gulp.

“What does it feel like?” whis­pered Hermione.

Har­ry did not an­swer for a mo­ment. Then, slow­ly but sure­ly, an ex­hil­arat­ing sense of in­fi­nite op­por­tu­ni­ty stole through him; he felt as though he could have done any­thing, any­thing at all… and get­ting the mem­ory from Slughorn seemed sud­den­ly not on­ly pos­sible, but pos­itive­ly easy. . . .

He got to his feet, smil­ing, brim­ming with con­fi­dence.

“Ex­cel­lent,” he said. “Re­al­ly ex­cel­lent. Right. . . I’m go­ing down to Ha­grid’s.”

“What?” said Ron and Hermione to­geth­er, look­ing aghast.

“No, Har­ry — you’ve got to go and see Slughorn, re­mem­ber?” said Hermione.

“No,” said Har­ry con­fi­dent­ly. “I’m go­ing to Ha­grid’s, I’ve got a good feel­ing about go­ing to Ha­grid’s.”

“You’ve got a good feel­ing about bury­ing a gi­ant spi­der?” asked Ron, look­ing stunned.

“Yeah,” said Har­ry, pulling his In­vis­ibil­ity Cloak out of his bag. “I feel like it’s the place to be tonight, you know what I mean?”

“No,” said Ron and Hermione to­geth­er, both look­ing pos­itive­ly alarmed now.

“This is Fe­lix Fe­li­cis, I sup­pose?” said Hermione anx­ious­ly, hold­ing up the bot­tle to the light. “You haven’t got an­oth­er lit­tle bot­tle full of— I don’t know —”

“Essence of In­san­ity?” sug­gest­ed Ron, as Har­ry swung his cloak over his shoul­ders.

Har­ry laughed, and Ron and Hermione looked even more alarmed.

“Trust me,” he said. “I know what I’m do­ing … or at least” he strolled con­fi­dent­ly to the door— “Fe­lix does.”

He pulled the In­vis­ibil­ity Cloak over his head and set off down the stairs, Ron and Hermione hur­ry­ing along be­hind him. At the foot of the stairs, Har­ry slid through the open door.

“What were you do­ing up there with her!” shrieked Laven­der Brown, star­ing right through Har­ry at Ron and Hermione emerg­ing to­geth­er from the boys’ dor­mi­to­ries. Har­ry heard Ron splut­ter­ing be­hind him as he dart­ed across the room away from them.

Get­ting through the por­trait hole was sim­ple; as he ap­proached it, Gin­ny and Dean came through it, and Har­ry was able to slip be­tween them. As he did so, he brushed ac­ci­den­tal­ly against Gin­ny.

“Don’t push me, please, Dean,” she said, sound­ing an­noyed. ; “You’re al­ways do­ing that, I can get through per­fect­ly well on my own. …”

The por­trait swung closed be­hind Har­ry, but not be­fore he had heard Dean make an an­gry re­tort.. . . His feel­ing of ela­tion in­creas­ing, Har­ry strode off through the cas­tle. He did not have to creep along, for he met no­body on his way, but this did not sur­prise him in the slight­est. This evening, he was the luck­iest per­son at Hog­warts.

Why he knew that go­ing to Ha­grid’s was the right thing to do, he had no idea. It was as though the po­tion was il­lu­mi­nat­ing a few steps of the path at a time. He could not see the fi­nal des­ti­na­tion, he could not see where Slughorn came in, but he knew that he was go­ing the right way to get that mem­ory. When he reached the en­trance hall he saw that Filch had for­got­ten to lock the front door. Beam­ing, Har­ry threw it open and breathed in the smell of clean air and grass for a mo­ment be­fore walk­ing down the steps in­to the dusk.

It was when he reached the bot­tom step that it oc­curred to him how very pleas­ant it would be to pass the veg­etable patch on his walk to Ha­grid’s. It was not strict­ly on the way, but it seemed clear to Har­ry that this was a whim on which he should act, so he di­rect­ed his feet im­me­di­ate­ly to­ward the veg­etable patch, where he was pleased, but not al­to­geth­er sur­prised, to find Pro­fes­sor Slughorn in con­ver­sa­tion with Pro­fes­sor Sprout. Har­ry lurked be­hind a low stone wall, feel­ing at peace with the world and lis­ten­ing to their con­ver­sa­tion.

“I do thank you for tak­ing the time, Pomona,” Slughorn was say­ing cour­te­ous­ly, “most au­thor­ities agree that they are at their most ef­fi­ca­cious if picked at twi­light.”

“Oh, I quite agree,” said Pro­fes­sor Sprout warm­ly. “That enough for you?”

“Plen­ty, plen­ty,” said Slughorn, who, Har­ry saw, was car­ry­ing an arm­ful of leafy plants. “This should al­low for a few leaves for each of my third years, and some to spare if any­body over­stews them. . . . Well, good evening to you, and many thanks again!”

Pro­fes­sor Sprout head­ed off in­to the gath­er­ing dark­ness in the di­rec­tion of her green­hous­es, and Slughorn di­rect­ed his steps to the spot where Har­ry stood, in­vis­ible.

Seized with an im­me­di­ate de­sire to re­veal him­self, Har­ry pul­let I off the cloak with a flour­ish.

“Good evening, Pro­fes­sor.”

“Mer­lin’s beard, Har­ry, you made me jump,” said Slughotn, stop­ping dead in his tracks and look­ing wary. “How did you get out of the cas­tle?”

“I think Filch must’ve for­got­ten to lock the doors,” said Har­ry cheer­ful­ly, and was de­light­ed to see Slughorn scowl.

“I’ll be re­port­ing that man, he’s more con­cerned about lit­ter than prop­er se­cu­ri­ty if you ask me. . . . But why are you out then, Har­ry?”

“Well, sir, it’s Ha­grid,” said Har­ry, who knew that the right thing to do just now was to tell the truth. “He’s pret­ty up­set. . . But you won’t tell any­one, Pro­fes­sor? I don’t want trou­ble for him. …”

Slughorn’s cu­rios­ity was ev­ident­ly aroused. “Well, I can’t promise that,” he said gruffly. “But I know that Dum­ble­dore trusts Ha­grid to the hilt, so I’m sure he can’t be up to any­thing very dread­ful. ..”

“Well, it’s this gi­ant spi­der, he’s had it for years. … It lived in the for­est. … It could talk and ev­ery­thing —”

“I heard ru­mors there were acro­man­tu­las in the for­est,” said Slughorn soft­ly, look­ing over at the mass of black trees. “It’s true, then?”

“Yes,” said Har­ry. “But this one, Ar­agog, the first one Ha­grid ev­er got, it died last night. He’s dev­as­tat­ed. He wants com­pa­ny while he buries it and I said I’d go.”

“Touch­ing, touch­ing,” said Slughorn ab­sent­mind­ed­ly, his large droopy eyes fixed up­on the dis­tant lights of Ha­grid’s cab­in. “But acro­man­tu­la ven­om is very valu­able … If the beast on­ly just died it might not yet have dried out. . . . Of course, I wouldn’t want to do any­thing in­sen­si­tive if Ha­grid is up­set. . . but if there was any way to pro­cure some … I mean, its al­most im­pos­si­ble to get ven­om from an acro­man­tu­la while its alive. …”

Slughorn seemed to be talk­ing more to him­self than Har­ry now. “. . . seems an aw­ful waste not to col­lect it… might get a hun­dred Galleons a pint. … To be frank, my salary is not large. . . .”

And now Har­ry saw clear­ly what was to be done. “Well,” he said, with a most con­vinc­ing hes­itan­cy, “well, if you want­ed to come, Pro­fes­sor, Ha­grid would prob­ably be re­al­ly pleased. . . . Give Ar­agog a bet­ter send­off, you know …”

“Yes, of course,” said Slughorn, his eyes now gleam­ing with en­thu­si­asm. “I tell you what, Har­ry, I’ll meet you down there with a bot­tle or two. . . . We’ll drink the poor beast’s — well — not health — but we’ll send it off in style, any­way, once it’s buried. And I’ll change my tie, this one is a lit­tle ex­uber­ant for the oc­ca­sion. . . .”

He bus­tled back in­to the cas­tle, and Har­ry sped off to Ha­grid’s, de­light­ed with him­self.

“Yen came,” croaked Ha­grid, when he opened the door and saw Har­ry emerg­ing from the In­vis­ibil­ity Cloak in front of him.

“Yeah — Ron and Hermione couldn’t, though,” said Har­ry. “They’re re­al­ly sor­ry.”

“Don — don mat­ter . . . Hed’ve bin touched yeh’re here, though, Har­ry. . .”

Ha­grid gave a great sob. He had made him­self a black arm­band out of what looked like a rag dipped in boot pol­ish, and his eyes were puffy, red, and swollen. Har­ry pat­ted him con­sol­ing­ly on the el­bow, which was the high­est point of Ha­grid he could eas­ily reach.

“Where are we bury­ing him?” he asked. “The for­est?”

“Blimey, no,” said Ha­grid, wip­ing his stream­ing eyes on the bot­tom of his shirt. “The oth­er spi­ders won’ let me any­where near their webs now Ar­agog’s gone. Turns out it was on­ly on his or­ders they didn’ eat me! Can yeh be­lieve that, Har­ry?”

The hon­est an­swer was “yes”; Har­ry re­called with painful ease the scene when he and Ron had come faceto­face with the aero­man­tu­las. They had been quite clear that Ar­agog was the on­ly thing that stopped them from eat­ing Ha­grid.

“Nev­er bin an area o’ the for­est I couldn’ go be­fore!” said Ha­grid, shak­ing his head. “It wasn’ easy, get­tin’ Ar­agog’s body out o’ there, I can tell yeh — they usu­al­ly eat their dead, see. . . . But I want­ed ter give ‘im a nice buri­al… a prop­er send­off. . .”

He broke in­to sobs again and Har­ry re­sumed the pat­ting of his el­bow, say­ing as he did so (for the po­tion seemed to in­di­cate that it was the right thing to do), “Pro­fes­sor Slughorn met me com­ing down here, Ha­grid.”

“Not in trou­ble, are yeh?” said Ha­grid, look­ing up, alarmed. “Yeh shouldn’ be out­ta the cas­tle in the evenin’, I know it, it’s my fault —”

“No, no, when he heard what I was do­ing he said he’d like to come and pay his last re­spects to Ar­agog too,” said Har­ry.

“He’s gone to change in­to some­thing more suit­able, I think…and he said he’d bring some bot­tles so we can drink to Ar­agog’s mem­ory…”

“Did he?” said Ha­grid, look­ing both as­ton­ished and touched. “Tha’s — tha’s righ’ nice of him, that is, an’ not turnin’ yeh in ei­ther. I’ve nev­er re­al­ly had a lot ter do with Ho­race Slughorn be­fore. .. . Comin’ ter see old Ar­agog off, though, eh? Well. . . he’d’ve liked that, Ar­agog would. . . .”

Har­ry thought pri­vate­ly that what Ar­agog would have liked most about Slughorn was the am­ple amount of ed­ible flesh he pro­vid­ed, but he mere­ly moved to the rear win­dow of Ha­grid’s hut, where he saw the rather hor­ri­ble sight of the enor­mous dead spi­der ly­ing on its back out­side, its legs curled and tan­gled.

“Are we go­ing to bury him here, Ha­grid, in your gar­den?”

“Jus’ be­yond the pump­kin patch, I thought,” said Ha­grid in a choked voice. “I’ve al­ready dug the — yeh know — grave. Jus’ thought we’d say a few nice things over him — hap­py mem­ories, yeh know —”

His voice quiv­ered and broke. There was a knock on the door, and he turned to an­swer it, blow­ing his nose on his great spot­ted hand­ker­chief as he did so. Slughorn hur­ried over the thresh­old, sev­er­al bot­tles in his arms, and wear­ing a somber black cra­vat.

“Ha­grid,” he said, in a deep, grave voice. “So very sor­ry to hear of your loss.”

“Tha’s very nice of yeh,” said Ha­grid. “Thanks a lot. An’ thanks fer not givin Har­ry de­ten­tion nei­ther. . . .”

“Wouldn’t have dreamed of it,” said Slughorn. “Sad night, sad night. . . Where is the poor crea­ture?”

“Out here,” said Ha­grid in a shak­ing voice. “Shall we — shall we do it, then?”

The three of them stepped out in­to the back gar­den. The moon was glis­ten­ing pale­ly through the trees now, and its rays min­gled with the light spilling from Ha­grid’s win­dow to il­lu­mi­nate Ar­agogs body ly­ing on the edge of a mas­sive pit be­side a ten­foot- high mound of fresh­ly dug earth.

“Mag­nif­icent,” said Slughorn, ap­proach­ing the spi­ders head, where eight milky eyes stared blankly at the sky and two huge, curved pin­cers shone, mo­tion­less, in the moon­light. Har­ry thougln he heard the tin­kle of bot­tles as Slughorn bent over the pin­cers, ap­par­ent­ly ex­am­in­ing the enor­mous hairy head.

“Its not ev’ry­one ap­pre­ci­ates how beau’iful they are’ said H grid to Slughorn’s back, tears leak­ing from the cor­ners of his crin­kled eyes. “I didn’ know yeh were in­ter­est­ed in crea­tures like Ar­agog, Ho­race.”

“In­ter­est­ed? My dear Ha­grid, I re­vere them,” said Slughorn, step­ping back from the body. Har­ry saw the glint of a bot­tle dis­ap­pear be­neath his cloak, though Ha­grid, mop­ping his eyes once more, no­ticed noth­ing. “Now . . . shall we pro­ceed to the buri­al?”

Ha­grid nod­ded and moved for­ward. He heaved the gi­gan­tic spi­der in­to his arms and, with an enor­mous grunt, rolled it in­to the dark pit. It hit the bot­tom with a rather hor­ri­ble, crunchy thud. Ha­grid start­ed to cry again.

“Of course, it’s dif­fi­cult for you, who knew him best,” said Slughorn, who like Har­ry could reach no high­er than Ha­grid’s el­bow, but pat­ted it all the same. “Why don’t I say a few words?”

He must have got a lot of good qual­ity ven­om from Ar­agog, Har­ry thought, for Slughorn wore a sat­is­fied smirk as he stepped up to the rim of the pit and said, in a slow, im­pres­sive voice, “Farewell, Ar­agog, king of arach­nids, whose long and faith­ful friend­ship those who knew you won’t for­get! Though your body will de­cay, your spir­it lingers on in the qui­et, web­spun places of your for­est home. May your manyeyed de­scen­dants ev­er flour­ish and your hu­man friends find so­lace for the loss they have sus­tained.”

“Tha was . . . tha was . . . beau’iful!” howled Ha­grid, and he col­lapsed on­to the com­post heap, cry­ing hard­er than ev­er.

“There, there,” said Slughorn, wav­ing his wand so that the huge pile of earth rose up and then fell, with a muf­fled sort of crash, on­to the dead spi­der, form­ing a smooth mound. “Lets get in­side and have a drink. Get on his oth­er side, Har­ry. . . . That’s it. … Up you come, Ha­grid . . . Well done …”

They de­posit­ed Ha­grid in a chair at the ta­ble. Fang, who had been skulk­ing in his bas­ket dur­ing the buri­al, now came padding soft­ly across to them and put his heavy head in­to Har­ry’s lap as usu­al. Slughorn un­corked one of the bot­tles of wine he had brought.

“I have had it all test­ed for poi­son,” he as­sured Har­ry, pour­ing most of the first bot­tle in­to one of Ha­grid’s buck­et­sized mugs and hand­ing it to Ha­grid. “Had a house­elf taste ev­ery bot­tle af­ter what hap­pened to your poor friend Ru­pert.”

Har­ry saw, in his mind’s eye, the ex­pres­sion on Hermione’s face if she ev­er heard about this abuse of house­elves, and de­cid­ed nev­er to men­tion it to her.

“One for Har­ry . . .” said Slughorn, di­vid­ing a sec­ond bot­tle be­tween two mugs, “. . . and one for me. Well” — he raised his mug high — “to Ar­agog.”

“Ar­agog,” said Har­ry and Ha­grid to­geth­er. Both Slughorn and Ha­grid drank deeply. Har­ry, how­ev­er, with the way ahead il­lu­mi­nat­ed for him by Fe­lix Fe­li­cis, knew that he must not drink, so he mere­ly pre­tend­ed to take a gulp and then set the mug back on the ta­ble be­fore him.

“I had him from an egg, yeh know,” said Ha­grid mo­rose­ly. “‘Tiny lit­tle thing he was when he hatched. ‘Bout the size of a Pekingese”

“Sweet,” said Slughorn.

“Used ter keep him in a cup­board up at the school un­til . . . well…”

Ha­grid’s face dark­ened and Har­ry knew why: Tom Rid­dle had con­trived to have Ha­grid thrown out of school, blamed for open­ing the Cham­ber of Se­crets. Slughorn, how­ev­er, did not seem to be lis­ten­ing; he was look­ing up at the ceil­ing, from which a num­ber of brass pots hung, and al­so a long, silky skein of bright white hair.

“That’s not uni­corn hair, Ha­grid?”

“Oh, yeah,” said Ha­grid in­dif­fer­ent­ly. “Gets pulled out of their tails, they catch it on branch­es an’ stuff in the for­est, yeh know …”

“But my dear chap, do you know how much that’s worth?”

“I use it fer bindin’ on ban­dages an stuff if a crea­ture gets in ju­red,” said Ha­grid, shrug­ging. “It’s dead use­ful. . . very strong.”

Slughorn took an­oth­er deep draught from his mug, his eyes mov­ing care­ful­ly around the cab­in now, look­ing, Har­ry knew, for more trea­sures that he might be able to con­vert in­to a plen­ti­ful su ply of oak­ma­tured mead, crys­tal­ized pineap­ple, and vel­vet smok­ing jack­ets. He re­filled Ha­grid’s mug and his own, and ques­tioned him about the crea­tures that lived in the for­est these days and how Ha­grid was able to look af­ter them all. Ha­grid, be­com­ing ex­pan­sive un­der the in­flu­ence of the drink and Slughorn’s flat­ter­ing in­ter­est, stopped mop­ping his eyes and en­tered hap­pi­ly in­to a long ex­pla­na­tion of bowtruck­le hus­bandry.

The Fe­lix Fe­li­cis gave Har­ry a lit­tle nudge at this point, and he no­ticed that the sup­ply of drink that Slughorn had brought was run­ning out fast. Har­ry had not yet man­aged to bring off the Re­fill­ing Charm with­out say­ing the in­can­ta­tion aloud, but the idea that he might not be able to do it tonight was laugh­able: In­deed, Har­ry grinned to him­self as, un­no­ticed by ei­ther Ha­grid or Slugli­orn (now swap­ping tales of the il­le­gal trade in drag­on eggs) he point­ed his wand un­der the ta­ble at the emp­ty­ing bot­tles and they im­me­di­ate­ly be­gan to re­fill.

Af­ter an hour or so, Ha­grid and Slughorn be­gan mak­ing ex­trav­agant toasts: to Hog­warts, to Dum­ble­dore, to elf­made wine, and to-

“Har­ry Pot­ter!” bel­lowed Ha­grid, slop­ping some of his four­teenth buck­et of wine down his chin as he drained it.

“Yes, in­deed,” cried Slughorn a lit­tle thick­ly, “Par­ry Ot­ter, the Cho­sen Boy Who — well — some­thing of that sort,” he mum­bled, and drained his mug too.

Not long af­ter this, Ha­grid be­came tear­ful again and pressed the whole uni­corn tail up­on Slughorn, who pock­et­ed it with cries of, “To friend­ship! To gen­eros­ity! To ten Galleons a hair!”

And for a while af­ter that, Ha­grid and Slughorn were sit­ting side by side, arms around each oth­er, singing a slow sad song about a dy­ing wiz­ard called Odo.

“Aaargh, the good die young,” mut­tered Ha­grid, slump­ing low on­to the ta­ble, a lit­tle crosseyed, while Slughorn con­tin­ued to war­ble the re­frain. “Me dad was no age ter go … nor were yer mum’ an’ dad, Har­ry . . .”

Great fat tears oozed out of the cor­ners of Ha­grid’s crin­kled eyes again; he grasped Har­ry’s arm and shook it

“Bes’ wiz and witchard o’ their age … I nev­er knew.. . ter­ri­ble thing . . . ter­ri­ble thing …”

“And Odo the hero, they bore him back home

To the place that he’d known as a lad,”

sang Slughorn plain­tive­ly.

“They laid him to rest with his hat in­side out.

And his wand snapped in two, which was sad.”

“. . . ter­ri­ble,” Ha­grid grunt­ed, and his great shag­gy head rolled side­ways on­to his arms and he fell asleep, snor­ing deeply.

“Sor­ry,” said Slughorn with a hic­cup. “Can’t car­ry a tune to save my life.”

“Ha­grid wasn’t talk­ing about your singing,” said Har­ry qui­et­ly. “He was talk­ing about my mum and dad dy­ing.”

“Oh,” said Slughorn, re­press­ing a large belch. “Oh dear. Yes, that was — was ter­ri­ble in­deed. Ter­ri­ble . . . ter­ri­ble …”

He looked quite at a loss for what to say, and re­sort­ed to re­fill­ing their mugs.

“I don’t — don’t sup­pose you re­mem­ber it, Har­ry?” he asked awk­ward­ly.

“No — well, I was on­ly one when they died,” said Har­ry, his eyes on the flame of the can­dle flick­er­ing in Ha­grid’s heavy snores. “But I’ve found out pret­ty much what hap­pened since. My dad died first. Did you know that?”

“I — I didn’t,” said Slughorn in a hushed voice.

“Yeah . . . Volde­mort mur­dered him and then stepped over his body to­ward my mum,” said Har­ry.

Slughorn gave a great shud­der, but he did not seem able to tear his hor­ri­fied gaze away from Har­ry’s face.

“He told her to get out of the way,” said Har­ry re­morse­less­ly. “He told me she needn’t have died. He on­ly want­ed me. She could have run.”

“Oh dear,” breathed Slughorn. “She could have . . . she needn’t . . . That’s aw­ful. . . .”

“It is, isn’t it?” said Har­ry, in a voice bare­ly more than a whis­per. “But she didn’t move. Dad was al­ready dead, but she didn’t want me to go too. She tried to plead with Volde­mort. . . but he just laughed….”

“That’s enough!” said Slughorn sud­den­ly, rais­ing a shak­ing hand. “Re­al­ly, my dear boy, enough . . . I’m an old man … I don’t need to hear … I don’t want to hear …”

“I for­got,” lied Har­ry, Fe­lix Fe­li­cis lead­ing him on. “You liked her, didn’t you?”

“Liked her?” said Slughorn, his eyes brim­ming with tears once more. “I don’t imag­ine any­one who met her wouldn’t have liked her. . . . Very brave . . . Very fun­ny… It was the most hor­ri­ble thing. …”

“But you won’t help her son,” said Har­ry. “She gave me her life, but you won’t give me a mem­ory.”

Ha­grid’s rum­bling snores filled the cab­in. Har­ry looked stea­di­ly in­to Slughorn’s tearfilled eyes. The Po­tions mas­ter seemed un­able to look away.

“Don’t say that,” he whis­pered. “It isn’t a ques­tion … If it were to help you, of course . . . but no pur­pose can be served . . .”

“It can,” said Har­ry clear­ly. “Dum­ble­dore needs in­for­ma­tion. I need in­for­ma­tion.”

He knew he was safe: Fe­lix was telling him that Slughorn would re­mem­ber noth­ing of this in the morn­ing. Look­ing Slughorn straight in the eye, Har­ry leaned for­ward a lit­tle.

“I am the Cho­sen One. I have to kill him. I need that mem­ory.”

Slughorn turned paler than ev­er; his shiny fore­head gleamed with sweat.

“You are the Cho­sen One?” . . I.

“Of course I am,” said Har­ry calm­ly.

“But then . . . my dear boy . . . you’re ask­ing a great deal. . . you’re ask­ing me, in fact, to aid you in your at­tempt to de­stroy-“

“You don’t want to get rid of the wiz­ard who killed Lily Evans?’”

“Har­ry, Har­ry, of course I do, but —”

“You’re scared he’ll find out you helped me?”

Slughorn said noth­ing; he looked ter­ri­fied.

“Be brave like my moth­er, Pro­fes­sor. . . .”

Slughorn raised a pudgy hand and pressed his shak­ing fin­gers to his mouth; he looked for a mo­ment like an enor­mous­ly over­grown ba­by.

“I am not proud . . .” he whis­pered through his fin­gers. “I am ashamed of what — of what that mem­ory shows. … I think I may have done great dam­age that day. …”

“You’d can­cel out any­thing you did by giv­ing me the mem­ory,” said Har­ry. “It would be a very brave and no­ble thing to do.”

Ha­grid twitched in his sleep and snored on. Slughorn and Har­ry stared at each oth­er over the gut­ter­ing can­dle. There was a long, long si­lence, but Fe­lix Fe­li­cis told Har­ry not to break it, to wait. Then, very slow­ly, Slughorn put his hand in his pock­et and pulled out his wand. He put his oth­er hand in­side his cloak and took out a small, emp­ty bot­tle. Still look­ing in­to Har­ry’s eyes, Slughorn touched the tip of his wand to his tem­ple and with­drew it, so that a long, sil­ver thread of mem­ory came away too, cling­ing to the wand tip. Longer and longer the mem­ory stretched un­til it broke and swung, sil­very bright, from the wand. Slughorn low­ered it in­to the bot­tle where it coiled, then spread, swirling like gas. He corked the bot­tle with a trem­bling hand and then passed it across the ta­ble to Har­ry.

“Thank you very much, Pro­fes­sor.”

“You’re a good boy,” said Pro­fes­sor Slughorn, tears trick­ling down his fat cheeks in­to his wal­rus mus­tache. “And you’ve got her eyes. . . . Just don’t think too bad­ly of me once you’ve seen it. . . ,”

And he too put his head on his arms, gave a deep sigh, and fell asleep.
