Chapter 21: The Unknowable Room


Har­ry wracked his brains over the next week as to how he was to per­suade Slughorn to hand over the true mem­ory, but noth­ing in the na­ture of a brain wave oc­curred and he was re­duced to do­ing what he did in­creas­ing­ly these days when at a loss: por­ing over his Po­tions book, hop­ing that the Prince would have scrib­bled some­thing use­ful in a mar­gin, as he had done so many times be­fore.

“You won’t find any­thing in there,” said Hermione firm­ly, late on Sun­day evening.

“Don’t start, Hermione,” said Har­ry. “If it hadn’t been for the Prince, Ron wouldn’t be sit­ting here now.”

“He would if you’d just lis­tened to Snape in our first year,” said Hermione dis­mis­sive­ly.

Har­ry ig­nored her. He had just found an in­can­ta­tion “Sec­tum­sem­pra!” scrawled in a mar­gin above the in­trigu­ing words “For en­emies,” and was itch­ing to try it out, but thought it best not to in front of Hermione. In­stead, he sur­rep­ti­tious­ly fold­ed down the cor­ner of the page. They were sit­ting be­side the fire in the com­mon room; the on­ly oth­er peo­ple awake were fel­low sixth years. There had been a cer­tain amount of ex­cite­ment ear­li­er when they had come back from din­ner to find a new sign on the no­tice board that an­nounced the date for their Ap­pari­tion Test. Those who would be sev­en­teen on or be­fore the first test date, the twen­ty­first of April, had the op­tion of sign­ing up for ad­di­tion­al prac­tice ses­sions, which would take place (heav­ily su­per­vised) in Hogsmeade.

Ron had pan­icked on read­ing this no­tice; he had still not man­aged to Ap­pa­rate and feared he would not be ready for the test. Hermione, who had now achieved Ap­pari­tion twice, was a lit­tle more con­fi­dent, but Har­ry, who would not be sev­en­teen for an­oth­er four months, could not take the test whether ready or not.

“At least you can Ap­pa­rate, though!” said Ron tense­ly. “You’ll have no trou­ble come Ju­ly!”

“I’ve on­ly done it once,” Har­ry re­mind­ed him; he had fi­nal­ly man­aged to dis­ap­pear and re­ma­te­ri­al­ize in­side his hoop dur­ing their pre­vi­ous les­son.

Hav­ing wast­ed a lot of time wor­ry­ing aloud about Ap­pari­tion, Ron was now strug­gling to fin­ish a vi­cious­ly dif­fi­cult es­say for Snape that Har­ry and Hermione had al­ready com­plet­ed. Har­ry ful­ly ex­pect­ed to re­ceive low marks on his, be­cause he had dis­agreed with Snape on the best way to tack­le de­men­tors, but he did not care: Slughorns mem­ory was the most im­por­tant thing to him now.

“I’m telling you, the stupid Prince isn’t go­ing to be able to help you with this, Har­ry!” said Hermione, more loud­ly. “There’s on­ly one way to force some­one to do what you want, and that’s the Im­perius Curse, which is il­le­gal —”

“Yeah, I know that, thanks,” said Har­ry, not look­ing up from the book. “That’s why I’m look­ing for some­thing dif­fer­ent. Dum­ble­dorf says Ver­itaserum won’t do it, but there might be some­thing else, a po­tion or a spell. . . .”

“You’re go­ing about it the wrong way,” said Hermione. “On­ly you can get the mem­ory, Dum­ble­dore says. That must mean you can per­suade Slughorn where oth­er peo­ple can’t. It’s not a ques­tion of slip­ping him a po­tion, any­one could do that —”

“How do you spell ‘bel­liger­ent’?” said Ron, shak­ing his quill very hard while star­ing at his parch­ment. “It can’t be B — U — M —”

“No, it isn’t,” said Hermione, pulling Ron’s es­say to­ward her. “And ‘au­gury’ doesn’t be­gin O — R — G ei­ther. What kind of quill are you us­ing?”

“It’s one of Fred and George’s SpellCheck ones, but I think the charm must be wear­ing off.”

“Yes, it must,” said Hermione, point­ing at the ti­tle of his es­say, “be­cause we were asked how we’d deal with de­men­tors, not ‘Dug­bogs’, and I don’t re­mem­ber you chang­ing your name to ‘Roonil Wa­zlib’ ei­ther.”

“Ah no!” said Ron, star­ing hor­rorstruck at the parch­ment. “Don’t say I’ll have to write the whole thing out again!”

“It’s okay, we can fix it,” said Hermione, pulling the es­say to­ward her and tak­ing out her wand.

“I love you, Hermione,” said Ron, sink­ing back in his chair, rub­bing his eyes weari­ly. Hermione turned faint­ly pink, but mere­ly said, “Don’t let Laven­der hear you say­ing that.”

“1 won’t,” said Ron in­to his hands. “Or maybe I will, then she’ll ditch me.”

“Why don’t you ditch her if you want to fin­ish it?” asked Har­ry.

“You haven’t ev­er chucked any­one, have you?” said Ron. “You and Cho just —”

“Sort of fell apart, yeah,” said Har­ry.

“Wish that would hap­pen with me and Laven­der,” said Ron gloo­mi­ly, watch­ing Hermione silent­ly tap­ping each of his mis­spelled words with the end of her wand, so that they cor­rect­ed them­selves on the page. “But the more I hint I want to fin­ish it, the tighter she holds on. It’s like go­ing out with the gi­ant squid.”

“There,” said Hermione, some twen­ty min­utes lat­er, hand­ing back Ron’s es­say.

“Thanks a mil­li­on,” said Ron. “Can I bor­row your quill for the con­clu­sion?” Har­ry, who had found noth­ing use­ful in the Half­Blood Prince’s notes so far, looked around; the three of them were now the on­ly ones left in the com­mon room, Sea­mus hav­ing just gone up to bed curs­ing Snape and his es­say. The on­ly sounds were the crack­ling of the fire and Ron scratch­ing out one last para­graph on de­men­tors us­ing Hermione’s quill. Har­ry had just closed the Half­Blood Prince’s book, yawn­ing, when —

Crack!

Hermione let out a lit­tle shriek; Ron spilled ink all over his fresh­ly com­plet­ed es­say, and Har­ry said, “Kreach­er!”

The house­elf bowed low and ad­dressed his own gnarled toes. “Mas­ter said he want­ed reg­ular re­ports on what the Mal­foy boy is do­ing, so Kreach­er has come to give–“

Crack!

Dob­by ap­peared along­side Kreach­er, his tea­cozy hat askew. “Dob­by has been help­ing too, Har­ry Pot­ter!” he squeaked, cast­ing Kreach­er a re­sent­ful look. “And Kreach­er ought to tell Dob­by when he is com­ing to see Har­ry Pot­ter so they can make their re­ports to­geth­er!”

“What is this?” asked Hermione, still look­ing shocked by these sud­den ap­pear­an­ces. “What’s go­ing on, Har­ry?” Har­ry hes­itat­ed be­fore an­swer­ing, be­cause he had not told Her­mione about set­ting Kreach­er and Dob­by to tail Mal­foy; house­elves were al­ways such a touchy sub­ject with her.

“Well. . . they’ve been fol­low­ing Mal­foy for me,” he said.

“Night and day,” croaked Kreach­er.

“Dob­by has not slept for a week, Har­ry Pot­ter!” said Dob­by proud­ly, sway­ing where he stood. Hermione looked in­dig­nant.

“You haven’t slept, Dob­by? But sure­ly, Har­ry, you didn’t tell him not to —”

“No, of course I didn’t,” said Har­ry quick­ly. “Dob­by, you can sleep, all right? But has ei­ther of you found out any­thing?” he has­tened to ask, be­fore Hermione could in­ter­vene again.

“Mas­ter Mal­foy moves with a no­bil­ity that be­fits his pure blood,” croaked Kreach­er at once. “His fea­tures re­call the fine bones of my mis­tress and his man­ners are those of—”

“Dra­co Mal­foy is a bad boy!” squeaked Dob­by an­gri­ly. “A bad boy who — who —” He shud­dered from the tas­sel of his tea cozy to the toes of his socks and then ran at the fire, as though about to dive in­to it. Har­ry, to whom this was not en­tire­ly un­ex­pect­ed, caught him around the mid­dle and held him fast. For a few sec­onds Dob­by strug­gled, then went limp.

“Thank you, Har­ry Pot­ter,” he pant­ed. “Dob­by still finds it dif­fi­cult to speak ill of his old mas­ters.” Har­ry re­leased him; Dob­by straight­ened his tea cozy and said de­fi­ant­ly to Kreach­er, “But Kreach­er should know that Dra­co Mal­foy is not a good mas­ter to a house­elf!”

“Yeah, we don’t need to hear about you be­ing in love with Mal­foy,” Har­ry told Kreach­er. “Let’s fast for­ward to where he’s ac­tu­al­ly been go­ing.”

Kreach­er bowed again, look­ing fu­ri­ous, and then said, “Mas­ter Mal­foy eats in the Great Hall, he sleeps in a dor­mi­to­ry in the dun­geons, he at­tends his class­es in a va­ri­ety of—”

“Dob­by, you tell me,” said Har­ry, cut­ting across Kreach­er. “Has he been go­ing any­where he shouldn’t have?”

“Har­ry Pot­ter, sir,” squeaked Dob­by, his great or­blike eyes shin­ing in the fire­light, “the Mal­foy boy is break­ing no rules that Dob­by can dis­cov­er, but he is still keen to avoid de­tec­tion. He has been mak­ing reg­ular vis­its to the sev­enth floor with a va­ri­ety of oth­er stu­dents, who keep watch for him while he en­ters —”

“The Room of Re­quire­ment!” said Har­ry, smack­ing him­self hard on the fore­head with Ad­vanced Po­tion­Mak­ing. Hermione and Ron stared at him. “That’s where he’s been sneak­ing off to! That’s where he’s do­ing… what­ev­er he’s do­ing! And I bet that’s why he’s been dis­ap­pear­ing off the map — come to think of it, I’ve nev­er seen the Room of Re­quire­ment on there!”

“Maybe the Ma­raud­ers nev­er knew the room was there,” said Ron.

“I think it’ll be part of the mag­ic of the room,” said Hermione. “If you need it to be un­plot­ta­ble, it will be.”

“Dob­by, have you man­aged to get in to have a look at what Mal­foy’s do­ing?” said Har­ry ea­ger­ly.

“No, Har­ry Pot­ter, that is im­pos­si­ble,” said Dob­by.

“No, it’s not,” said Har­ry at once. “Mal­foy got in­to our head­quar­ters there last year, so I’ll be able to get in and spy on him, no prob­lem.”

“But I don’t think you will, Har­ry,” said Hermione slow­ly. “Mal­foy al­ready knew ex­act­ly how we were us­ing the room, didn’t he, be­cause that stupid Ma­ri­et­ta had blabbed. He need­ed the room to be­come the head­quar­ters of the D.A., so it did. But you don’t know what the room be­comes when Mal­foy goes in there, so you don’t know what to ask it to trans­form in­to.”

“There’ll be a way around that,” said Har­ry dis­mis­sive­ly. “You’ve done bril­liant­ly, Dob­by.”

“Kreach­ers done well too,” said Hermione kind­ly; but far from look­ing grate­ful, Kreach­er avert­ed his huge, blood­shot eyes and croaked at the ceil­ing, “The Mud­blood is speak­ing to Kreach­er, Kreach­er will pre­tend he can­not hear —”

“Get out of it,” Har­ry snapped at him, and Kreach­er made one last deep bow and Dis­ap­pa­rat­ed. “You’d bet­ter go and get some sleep too, Dob­by.”

“Thank you, Har­ry Pot­ter, sir!” squeaked Dob­by hap­pi­ly, and he too van­ished.

“How good is this?” said Har­ry en­thu­si­as­ti­cal­ly, turn­ing to Ron and Hermione the mo­ment the room was elf­free again. “We know where Mal­foy’s go­ing! We’ve got him cor­nered now!”

“Yeah, it’s great,” said Ron glum­ly, who was at­tempt­ing to mop up the sod­den mass of ink chat had re­cent­ly been an al­most com­plet­ed es­say. Hermione pulled it to­ward her and be­gan si­phon­ing the ink off with her wand.

“But what’s all this about him go­ing up there with a va­ri­ety of stu­dents’?” said Hermione. “How many peo­ple are in on it? You wouldn’t think he’d trust lots of them to know what he’s do­ing—“

“Yeah, that is weird,” said Har­ry, frown­ing. “I heard him telling Crabbe it wasn’t Crabbe’s busi­ness what he was do­ing… so what’s he telling all these… all these…” Har­ry’s voice tailed away; he was star­ing at the fire. “God, I’ve been stupid,” he said qui­et­ly. “Its ob­vi­ous, isn’t it? There was a great vat of it down in the dun­geon. . . . He could’ve nicked some any time dur­ing that les­son. . . .”

“Nicked what?” said Ron.

“Polyjuice Po­tion. He stole some of the Polyjuice Po­tion Slughorn showed us in our first Po­tions les­son… There aren’t a whole va­ri­ety of stu­dents stand­ing guard for Mal­foy… it’s just Crabbe and Goyle as usu­al. …Yeah, it all fits!” said Har­ry, jump­ing up and start­ing to pace in front of the fire. “They’re stupid enough to do what they’re told even if he won’t tell them what he’s up to, but he doesn’t want them to be seen lurk­ing around out­side the Room of Re­quire­ment, so he’s got them tak­ing Polyjuice to make them look like oth­er peo­ple… Those two girls I saw him with when he missed Quid­ditch — ha! Crabbe and Goyle!”

“Do you mean to say,” said Hermione in a hushed voice, “that that lit­tle girl whose scales I re­paired — ?”

“Yeah, of course!” said Har­ry loud­ly, star­ing at her. “Of course! Mal­foy must’ve been in­side the room at the time, so she — what am I talk­ing about? — he dropped the scales to tell Mal­foy not to corne out, be­cause there was some­one there! And there was that girl who dropped the toad­spawn too! We’ve been walk­ing past him all the time and not re­al­iz­ing it!”

“He’s got Crabbe and Goyle trans­form­ing in­to girls?” guf­fawed Ron. “Blimey… no won­der they don’t look too hap­py these days. I’m sur­prised they don’t tell him to stuff it.”

“Well, they wouldn’t, would they, if he’s shown them his Dark Mark?” said Har­ry.

“Hm­mm… the Dark Mark we don’t know ex­ists,” said Her­mi­one skep­ti­cal­ly, rolling up Ron’s dried es­say be­fore it could come to any more harm and hand­ing it to him.

“We’ll see” said Har­ry con­fi­dent­ly.

“Yes, we will,” Hermione said, get­ting to her feet and stretch­ing. “But, Har­ry, be­fore you get all ex­cit­ed, I still don’t think you’ll be able to get in­to the Room of Re­quire­ment with­out know­ing what’s there first’. And I don’t think you should for­get” — she heaved her bag on­to her shoul­der and gave him a very se­ri­ous look — “that what you’re sup­posed to be con­cen­trat­ing on is get­ting that mem­ory from Slughorn. Good night.”

Har­ry watched her go, feel­ing slight­ly dis­grun­tled. Once the door to the girls’ dor­mi­to­ries had closed be­hind her he round­ed on Ron. “What d’you think?”

“Wish I could Dis­ap­pa­rate like a house­elf,” said Ron, star­ing at the spot where Dob­by had van­ished. “I’d have that Ap­pari­tion Test in the bag.”

Har­ry did not sleep well that night. He lay awake for what felt like hours, won­der­ing how Mal­foy was us­ing the Room of Re­quire­ment and what he, Har­ry, would see when he went in there the fol­low­ing day, for what­ev­er Hermione said, Har­ry was sure that if Mal­foy had-=- been able to see the head­quar­ters of the D.A., he would be able to see Mal­foy’s, what could it be? A meet­ing place? A hide­out? A ston room? A work­shop? Har­rys mind worked fever­ish­ly and his dreams, when he fi­nal­ly fell asleep, were bro­ken and dis­turbed by im­ages of Mal­foy, who turned in­to Slughorn, who turned in­to Snape…

Har­ry was in a state of great an­tic­ipa­tion over break­fast the fol­low­ing morn­ing; he had a free pe­ri­od be­fore De­fense Against the Dark Arts and was de­ter­mined to spend it try­ing to get in­to the Room of Re­quire­ment. Hermione was rather os­ten­ta­tious­ly show­ing no in­ter­est in his whis­pered plans for forc­ing en­try in­to the room, which ir­ri­tat­ed Har­ry, be­cause he thought she might be a lot of help if she want­ed to.

“Look,” he said qui­et­ly, lean­ing for­ward and putting a hand on the Dai­ly Prophet, which she had just re­moved from a post owl, to stop her from open­ing it and van­ish­ing be­hind it. “I haven’t for­got­ten about Slughorn, but I haven’t got a clue how to get that mem­ory off him, and un­til I get a brain wave why shouldn’t I find out what Mal­foy’s do­ing?”

“I’ve al­ready told you, you need to per­suade Slughorn,” said Her­mione. “It’s not a ques­tion of trick­ing him or be­witch­ing him, or Dum­ble­dore could have done it in a sec­ond. In­stead of mess­ing around out­side the Room of Re­quire­ment” — she jerked the Prophet out from un­der Har­rys hand and un­fold­ed it to look at the front page — “you should go and find Slughorn and start ap­peal­ing to his bet­ter na­ture.”

“Any­one we know — ?” asked Ron, as Hermione scanned the head­lines.

“Yes!” said Hermione, caus­ing both Har­ry and Ron to gag on their break­fast. “But it’s all right, he’s not dead — its Mundun­gus, he’s been ar­rest­ed and sent to Azk­aban! Some­thing to do with im­per­son­at­ing an In­ferius dur­ing an at­tempt­ed bur­glary, and some­one called Oc­tavius Pep­per has van­ished. Oh, and how hor­ri­ble, a nineyearold boy has been ar­rest­ed for try­ing to kill his grand­par­ents, they think he was un­der the Im­perius Curse.”

They fin­ished their break­fast in si­lence. Hermione set off imme­di­ate­ly for An­cient Runes; Ron for the com­mon room, where he still had to fin­ish his con­clu­sion on Snape’s de­men­tor es­say, and Har­ry for the cor­ri­dor on the sev­enth floor and the stretch of wall op­po­site the tapestry of Barn­abas the Barmy teach­ing trolls to do bal­let.

Har­ry slipped on his In­vis­ibil­ity Cloak once he had found an emp­ty pas­sage, but he need not have both­ered. When he reached his des­ti­na­tion he found it de­sert­ed. Har­ry was not sure whether his chances of get­ting in­side the room were bet­ter with Mal­foy in­side it or out, but at least his first at­tempt was not go­ing to be com­pli­cat­ed by the pres­ence of Crabbe or Goyle pre­tend­ing to be an elevenyearold girl.

He closed his eyes as he ap­proached the place where the Room of Re­quire­ment’s door was con­cealed. He knew what he had to do; he had be­come most ac­com­plished at it last year. Con­cen­trat­ing with all his might he thought, “I need to see what Mal­foy’s do­ing in here… I need to see what Mal­foy’s do­ing in here… I need to see what Mal­foy’s do­ing in here…”

Three times he walked past the door; then, his heart pound­ing with ex­cite­ment, he opened his eyes and faced it — but he was still look­ing at a stretch of mun­dane­ly blank wall. He moved for­ward and gave it an ex­per­imen­tal push. The stone re­mained sol­id and un­yield­ing.

“Okay,” said Har­ry aloud. “Okay… I thought the wrong thing…” He pon­dered for a mo­ment then set off again, eyes closed, con­cen­trat­ing as hard as he could. “I need to see the place where Mal­foy keeps com­ing se­cret­ly… I need to see the place where Mal­foy keeps com­ing se­cret­ly…” Af­ter three walks past, he opened his eyes ex­pec­tant­ly.

There was no door.

“Oh, come off it,” he told the wall ir­ri­ta­bly. “That was a clear in­struc­tion. Fine.” He thought hard for sev­er­al min­utes be­fore strid­ing off once more. “I need you to be­come the place you be­come for Dra­co Mal­foy…”

He did not im­me­di­ate­ly open his eyes when he had fin­ished his pa­trolling; he was lis­ten­ing hard, as though he might hear the door pop in­to ex­is­tence. He heard noth­ing, how­ev­er, ex­cept the dis­tant twit­ter­ing of birds out­side. He opened his eyes.

There was still no door.

Har­ry swore. Some­one screamed. He looked around to see a gag­gle of first years run­ning back around the cor­ner, ap­par­ent­ly un­der the im­pres­sion that they had just en­coun­tered a par­tic­ular­ly foul­mouthed ghost.

Har­ry tried ev­ery vari­ation of “I need to see what Dra­co Mal­foy is do­ing in­side you” that he could think of for a whole hour, at the end of which he was forced to con­cede that Hermione might have had a point: The room sim­ply did not want to open for him. Frus­trat­ed and an­noyed, he set off for De­fense Against the Dark Arts, pulling off his In­vis­ibil­ity Cloak and stuff­ing it in­to his bag as he went.

“Late again, Pot­ter,” said Snape cold­ly, as Har­ry hur­ried in­to the can­dlelit class­room. “Ten points from Gryfrindor.” Har­ry scowled at Snape as he flung him­self in­to the seat be­side Ron. Half the class were still on their feet, tak­ing out books and or­ga­niz­ing their things; he could not be much lat­er than any of them.

“Be­fore we start, I want your de­men­tor es­says,” said Snape, wav­ing his wand care­less­ly, so that twen­ty­five scrolls of parch­ment soared in­to the air and land­ed in a neat pile on his desk. “And I hope for your sakes they are bet­ter than the tripe I had to en­dure on re­sist­ing the Im­perius Curse. Now, if you will all open your books to page — what is it, Mr. Finni­gan?”

“Sir,” said Sea­mus, “I’ve been won­der­ing, how do you tell the dif­fer­ence be­tween an In­ferius and a ghost? Be­cause there was some­thing in the pa­per about an In­ferius —”

“No, there wasn’t,” said Snape in a bored voice.

“But sir, I heard peo­ple talk­ing —”

“If you had ac­tu­al­ly read the ar­ti­cle in ques­tion, Mr. Finni­gan, you would have known that the so­called In­ferius was noth­ing but a smelly sneak thief by the name of Mundun­gus Fletch­er.”

“I thought Snape and Mundun­gus were on the same side,” mut­tered Har­ry to Ron and Hermione. “Shouldn’t he be up­set Mun­dun­gus has been ar­rest —”

“But Pot­ter seems to have a lot to say on the sub­ject,” said Snape, point­ing sud­den­ly at the back of the room, his black eyes fixed on Har­ry. “Let us ask Pot­ter how we would tell the dif­fer­ence be­tween an In­ferius and a ghost.”

The whole class looked around at Har­ry, who hasti­ly tried to re­call what Dum­ble­dore had told him the night that they had gone to vis­it Slughorn. “Er — well — ghosts are trans­par­ent —” he said.

“Oh, very good,” in­ter­rupt­ed Snape, his lip curl­ing. “Yes, it in easy to see that near­ly six years of mag­ical ed­uca­tion have not been wast­ed on you, Pot­ter. ‘Ghosts are trans­par­ent.”‘

Pan­sy Parkin­son let out a high­pitched gig­gle. Sev­er­al oth­er peo­ple were smirk­ing. Har­ry took a deep breath and con­tin­ued calm­ly, though his in­sides were boil­ing, “Yeah, ghosts are trans­par­ent, but In­feri are dead bod­ies, aren’t they? So they’d be sol­id —”

“A fiveyearold could have told us as much,” sneered Snape. “The In­ferius is a corpse that has been re­an­imat­ed by a Dark wiz­ard’s spells. It is not alive, it is mere­ly used like a pup­pet to do the wiz­ard’s bid­ding. A ghost, as I trust that you are all aware by now, is the im­print of a de­part­ed soul left up­on the earth, and of course, as Pot­ter so wise­ly tells us, trans­par­ent. “

“Well, what Har­ry said is the most use­ful if we’re try­ing to tell them apart!” said Ron. “When we come faceto­face with one down a dark al­ley, we’re go­ing to be hav­ing a look to see if its sol­id, aren’t we, we’re not go­ing to be ask­ing, ‘Ex­cuse me, are you the im­print of a de­part­ed soul?’” There was a rip­ple of laugh­ter, in­stant­ly quelled by the look Snape gave the class.

“An­oth­er ten points from Gryffind­or,” said Snape. “I would ex­pect noth­ing more so­phis­ti­cat­ed from you, Ronald Weasley, the boy so sol­id he can­not Ap­pa­rate half an inch across a room.”

“No!” whis­pered Hermione, grab­bing Har­rys arm as he opened his mouth fu­ri­ous­ly. “There’s no point, you’ll just end up in de­ten­tion again, leave it!”

“Now open your books to page two hun­dred and thir­teen,” said Snape, smirk­ing a lit­tle, “and read the first two para­graphs on the Cru­cia­tus Curse.”

Ron was very sub­dued all through the class. When the bell sound­ed at the end of the les­son, Laven­der caught up with Ron and Har­ry (Hermione mys­te­ri­ous­ly melt­ed out of sight as she ap­proached) and abused Snape hot­ly for his jibe about Ron’s Ap­pari­tion, but this seemed to mere­ly ir­ri­tate Ron, and he shook her off by mak­ing a de­tour in­to the boys’ bath­room with Har­ry.

“Snape’s right, though, isn’t he?” said Ron, af­ter star­ing in­to a cracked mir­ror for a minute or two. “I dun­no whether it’s worth me tak­ing the test. I just can’t get the hang of Ap­pari­tion.”

“You might as well do the ex­tra prac­tice ses­sions in Hogsmeade and see where they get you,” said Har­ry rea­son­ably. “It’ll be more in­ter­est­ing than try­ing to get in­to a stupid hoop any­way. Then, if you’re still not — you know — as good as you’d like to be, you can post­pone the test, do it with me over the sum­mer — Myr­tle, this is the boys’ bath­room!”

The ghost of a girl had risen out of the toi­let in a cu­bi­cle be­hind them and was now float­ing in midair, star­ing at them through thick, white, round glass­es. “Oh,” she said glum­ly. “It’s you two.”

“Who were you ex­pect­ing?” said Ron, look­ing at her in the mir­ror.

“No­body,” said Myr­tle, pick­ing mood­ily at a spot on her chin. “He said he’d come back and see me, but then you said you’d pop in and vis­it me too” — she gave Har­ry a re­proach­ful look — “and I haven’t seen you for months and months. I’ve learned not to ex­pect too much from boys.”

“I thought you lived in that girls’ bath­room?” said Har­ry, who had been care­ful to give the place a wide berth for some years now.

“I do,” she said, with a sulky lit­tle shrug, “but that doesn’t mean I cant vis­it oth­er places. I came and saw you in your bath once, re­mem­ber?”

“Vivid­ly,” said Har­ry.

“But I thought he liked me,” she said plain­tive­ly. “Maybe if you two left, he’d come back again. We had lots in com­mon. I’m sure he felt it.”

And she looked hope­ful­ly to­ward the door. “When you say you had lots in com­mon,” said Ron, sound­ing rather amused now, “d’you mean he lives in an Sbend too?”

“No,” said Myr­tle de­fi­ant­ly, her voice echo­ing loud­ly around the old tiled bath­room. “I mean he’s sen­si­tive, peo­ple bul­ly him too, and he feels lone­ly and hasn’t got any­body to talk to, and he’s not afraid to show his feel­in­gs and cry!”

“There’s been a boy in here cry­ing?” said Har­ry cu­ri­ous­ly. “A young boy?”

“Nev­er you mind!” said Myr­tle, her small, leaky eyes fixed on Ron, who was now def­inite­ly grin­ning. “I promised I wouldn’t tell any­one, and I’ll take his se­cret to the —”

“— not the grave, sure­ly?” said Ron with a snort. “The sew­ers, maybe.” Myr­tle gave a howl of rage and dived back in­to the toi­let, caus­ing wa­ter to slop over the sides and on­to the floor. Goad­ing Myr­tle seemed to have put fresh heart in­to Ron. “You’re right,” he said, swing­ing his school­bag back over his shoul­der, “I’ll do the prac­tice ses­sions in Hogsmeade be­fore I de­cide about tak­ing the test.”

And so the fol­low­ing week­end, Ron joined Hermione and the rest of the sixth years who would turn sev­en­teen in time to take the test in a fort­night. Har­ry felt rather jeal­ous watch­ing them all get ready to go in­to the vil­lage; he missed mak­ing trips there, and it was a par­tic­ular­ly fine spring day, one of the first clear skies they had seen in a long time. How­ev­er, he had de­cid­ed to use the time to at­tempt an­oth­er as­sault on the Room of Re­quire­ment.

“You’d do bet­ter,” said Hermione, when he con­fid­ed this plan to Ron and her in the en­trance hall, “to go straight to Slughorn’s of­fice and try and get that mem­ory from him.”

“I’ve been try­ing!” said Har­ry cross­ly, which was per­fect­ly true. He had lagged be­hind af­ter ev­ery Po­tions les­son that week in an at­tempt to cor­ner Slughorn, but the Po­tions mas­ter al­ways left the dun­geon so fast that Har­ry had not been able to catch him. Twice, Har­ry had gone to his of­fice and knocked, but re­ceived no re­ply, though on the sec­ond oc­ca­sion he was sure he had heard the quick­ly sti­fled sounds of an old gramo­phone.

“He doesn’t want to talk to me, Hermione! He can tell I’ve been try­ing to get him on his own again, and he’s not go­ing to let it hap­pen!”

“Well, you’ve just got to keep at it, haven’t you?”

The short queue of peo­ple wait­ing to file past Filch, who was do­ing his usu­al prod­ding act with the Se­cre­cy Sen­sor, moved for­ward a few steps and Har­ry did not an­swer in case he was over­heard by the care­tak­er. He wished Ron and Hermione both luck, then turned and climbed the mar­ble stair­case again, de­ter­mined, what­ev­er Her­mione said, to de­vote an hour or two to the Room of Re­quire­ment.

Once out of sight of the en­trance hall, Har­ry pulled the Ma­raud­er’s Map and his In­vis­ibil­ity Cloak from his bag. Hav­ing con­cealed him­self, he tapped the map, mur­mured, “I solemn­ly swear that I am up to no good,” and scanned it care­ful­ly.

As it was Sun­day morn­ing, near­ly all the stu­dents were in­side their var­ious com­mon rooms, the Gryffind­ors in one tow­er, the Raven­claws in an­oth­er, the Slytherins in the dun­geons, and the Huf­flepuffs in the base­ment near the kitchens. Here and there a stray per­son me­an­dered around the li­brary or up a cor­ri­dor. There were a few peo­ple out in the grounds, and there, alone in the sev­en­th­floor cor­ri­dor, was Gre­go­ry Goyle. There was no sign of the Room of Re­quire­ment, but Har­ry was not wor­ried about that; if Goyle was stand­ing guard out­side it, the room was open, whether the map was aware of it or not. He there­fore sprint­ed up the stairs, slow­ing down on­ly when he reached the cor­ner in­to the cor­ri­dor, when he be­gan to creep, very slow­ly, to­ward the very same lit­tle girl, clutch­ing her heavy brass scales, that Hermione had so kind­ly helped a fort­night be­fore. He wait­ed un­til he was right be­hind her be­fore bend­ing very low and whis­per­ing, “Hel­lo…you’re very pret­ty, aren’t you?”

Goyle gave a high­pitched scream of ter­ror, threw the scales up in­to the air, and sprint­ed away, van­ish­ing from sight long be­fore the sound of the scales smash­ing had stopped echo­ing around the cor­ri­dor. Laugh­ing, Har­ry turned to con­tem­plate the blank wall be­hind which, he was sure, Dra­co Mal­foy was now stand­ing frozen, aware that some­one un­wel­come was out there, but not dar­ing to make an ap­pear­an­ce. It gave Har­ry a most agree­able feel­ing of pow­er as he tried to re­mem­ber what form of words he had not yet tried.

Yet this hope­ful mood did not last long. Half an hour lat­er, hav­ing tried many more vari­ations of his re­quest to see what Mal­foy was up to, the wall was just as door­less as ev­er. Har­ry felt frus­trat­ed be­yond be­lief-=Mal­foy might be just feet away from him, and there was still not the ti­ni­est shred of ev­idence as to what he was do­ing in there. Los­ing his pa­tience com­plete­ly, Har­ry ran at the wall and kicked it.

“OUCH!”

He thought he might have bro­ken his toe; as he clutched it and hopped on one foot, the In­vis­ibil­ity Cloak slipped off him.

“Har­ry?”

He spun around, one­legged, and top­pled over. There, to his ut­ter as­ton­ish­ment, was Tonks, walk­ing to­ward him as though she fre­quent­ly strolled up this cor­ri­dor.

“What’re you do­ing here?” he said, scram­bling to his feet again; why did she al­ways have to find him ly­ing on the floor?

“I came to see Dum­ble­dore,” said Tonks. Har­ry thought she looked ter­ri­ble: thin­ner than usu­al, her mousec­ol­ored hair lank.

“His of­fice isn’t here,” said Har­ry, “it’s round the oth­er side of the cas­tle, be­hind the gar­goyle —”

“I know,” said Tonks. “He’s not there. Ap­par­ent­ly he’s gone away again.”

“Has he?” said Har­ry, putting his bruised foot gin­ger­ly back on the floor. “Hey — you don’t know where he goes, I sup­pose?”

“No,” said Tonks.

“What did you want to see him about?”

“Noth­ing in par­tic­ular,” said Tonks, pick­ing, ap­par­ent­ly un­con­scious­ly, at the sleeve of her robe. “I just thought he might know what’s go­ing on. I’ve heard ru­mors… peo­ple get­ting hurt.”

“Yeah, I know, it’s all been in the pa­pers,” said Har­ry. “That lit­tle kid try­ing to kill his —”

“The Prophet’s of­ten be­hind the times,” said Tonks, who didn’t seem to be lis­ten­ing to him. “You haven’t had any let­ters from any­one in the Or­der re­cent­ly?”

“No one from the Or­der writes to me any­more,” said Har­ry, “not since Sir­ius —“ He saw that her eyes had filled with tears.

“I’m sor­ry,” he mut­tered awk­ward­ly. “I mean… I miss him, as well.”

“What?” said Tonks blankly, as though she had not heard him. “Well. I’ll see you around, Har­ry.”

And she turned abrupt­ly and walked back down the cor­ri­dor, leav­ing Har­ry to stare af­ter her. Af­ter a minute or so, he pulled the In­vis­ibil­ity Cloak on again and re­sumed his ef­forts to get in­to the Room of Re­quire­ment, but his heart was not in it. Fi­nal­ly, a hol­low feel­ing in his stom­ach and the knowl­edge that Ron and Hermione would soon be back for lunch made him aban­don the at­tempt and leave the cor­ri­dor to Mal­foy who, hope­ful­ly, would be too afraid to leave for some hours to come.

He found Ron and Hermione in the Great Hall, al­ready halfway through an ear­ly lunch.

“I did it — well, kind of!” Ron told Har­ry en­thu­si­as­ti­cal­ly when he caught sight of him. “I was sup­posed to be Ap­pa­rat­ing to out­side Madam Pud­di­foots Tea Shop and I over­shot it a bit, end­ed up near Scriv­en­shafts, but at least I moved!”

“Good one,” said Har­ry. “How’d you do, Hermione?”

“Oh, she was per­fect, ob­vi­ous­ly,” said Ron, be­fore Hermione could an­swer. “Per­fect de­lib­er­ation, div­ina­tion, and des­per­ation or what­ev­er the hell it is — we all went for a quick drink in the Three Broom­sticks af­ter and you should’ve heard Twycross go­ing on about her — I’ll be sur­prised if he doesn’t pop the ques­tion soon —”

“And what about you?” asked Hermione, ig­nor­ing Ron. “Have you been up at the Room of Re­quire­ment all this time?”

“Yep,” said Har­ry. “And guess who I ran in­to up there? Tonks!”

“Tonks?” re­peat­ed Ron and Hermione to­geth­er, look­ing sur­prised.

“Yeah, she said she’d come to vis­it Dum­ble­dore.”

“If you ask me,” said Ron once Har­ry had fin­ished de­scrib­ing his con­ver­sa­tion with Tonks, “she’s crack­ing up a bit. Los­ing her nerve af­ter what hap­pened at the Min­istry.”

“It’s a bit odd,” said Hermione, who for some rea­son looked very con­cerned. “She’s sup­posed to be guard­ing the school, why she sud­den­ly aban­don­ing her post to come and see Dum­ble­dore when he’s not even here?”

“I had a thought,” said Har­ry ten­ta­tive­ly. He felt strange about voic­ing it; this was much more Hermione’s ter­ri­to­ry than his. “You don’t think she can have been… you know… in love with Sir­ius?”

Hermione stared at him. “What on earth makes you say that?”

“I dun­no,” said Har­ry, shrug­ging, “but she was near­ly cry­ing when I men­tioned his name, and her Pa­tronus is a big four­legged thing now. I won­dered whether it hadn’t be­come… you know… him.”

“It’s a thought,” said Hermione slow­ly. “But I still don’t know why she’d be burst­ing in­to the cas­tle to see Dum­ble­dore, if that’s re­al­ly why she was here.”

“Goes back to what I said, doesn’t it?” said Ron, who was now shov­el­ing mashed pota­to in­to his mouth. “She’s gone a bit fun­ny. Lost her nerve. Wom­en,” he said wise­ly to Har­ry, “they’re eas­ily up­set.”

“And yet,” said Hermione, com­ing out of her rev­er­ie, “I doubt you’d find a wom­an who sulked for half an hour be­cause Madam Ros­mer­ta didn’t laugh at their joke about the hag, the Heal­er, and the Mim­bu­lus mim­ble­to­nia.”

Ron scowled.
