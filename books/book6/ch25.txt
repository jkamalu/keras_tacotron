Chapter 25: The Seer Overheard


The fact that Har­ry Pot­ter was go­ing out with Gin­ny Weasley seemed to in­ter­est a great num­ber of peo­ple, most of them girls, yet Har­ry found him­self new­ly and hap­pi­ly im­per­vi­ous to gos­sip over the next few weeks. Af­ter all, it made a very nice change to be talked about be­cause of some­thing that was mak­ing him hap­pi­er than he could re­mem­ber be­ing for a very long time, rather than be­cause he had been in­volved in hor­rif­ic scenes of Dark mag­ic.

‘You’d think peo­ple had bet­ter things to gos­sip about,’ said Gin­ny, as she sat on the com­mon­room floor, lean­ing against Har­ry’s legs and read­ing the Dai­ly Prophet. Three De­men­tor at­tacks in a week, and all Romil­da Vane does is ask me if it’s true you’ve got a Hip­pogriff tat­tooed across your chest.’

Ron and Hermione both roared with laugh­ter. Har­ry ig­nored them.

‘What did you tell her?’

‘ ? told her it’s a Hun­gar­ian Horn­tail,’ said Gin­ny, turn­ing a page of the news­pa­per idly. ‘Much more ma­cho.’

Thanks,’ said Har­ry, grin­ning. ‘And what did you tell her Ron’s got?’

‘A Pygmy Puff, but I didn’t say where.’

Ron scowled as Hermione rolled around laugh­ing.

‘Watch it,’ he said, point­ing wam­ing­ly at Har­ry and Gin­ny. ‘Just be­cause I’ve giv­en my per­mis­sion doesn’t mean I can’t with­draw it -’

“Tour per­mis­sion”,’ scoffed Gin­ny. ‘Since when did you give me per­mis­sion to do any­thing? Any­way, you said your­self you’d rather it was Har­ry than Michael or Dean.’

‘Yeah, 1 would,’ said Ron grudg­ing­ly. ‘And just as long as you don’t start snog­ging each oth­er in pub­lic -’

‘You filthy hyp­ocrite! What about you and Laven­der, thrash­ing around like a pair of eels all over the place?’ de­mand­ed Gin­ny.

But Ron’s tol­er­an­ce was not to be test­ed much as they moved in­to June, for Har­ry and Gin­ny’s time to­geth­er was be­com­ing in­creas­ing­ly re­strict­ed. Gin­ny’s O.W.L.s were ap­proach­ing and she was there­fore forced to re­vise for hours in­to the night. On one such evening, when Gin­ny had re­tired to the li­brary and Har­ry was sit­ting be­side the win­dow in the com­mon room, sup­pos­ed­ly fin­ish­ing his Her­bol­ogy home­work but in re­al­ity re­liv­ing a par­tic­ular­ly hap­py hour he had spent down by the lake with Gin­ny at lunchtime, Hermione dropped in­to the seat be­tween him and Ron with an un­pleas­ant­ly pur­pose­ful look on her face.

‘I want to talk to you, Har­ry.’

‘What about?’ said Har­ry sus­pi­cious­ly. On­ly the pre­vi­ous day, Hermione had told him off for dis­tract­ing Gin­ny when she ought to be work­ing hard for her ex­am­ina­tions.

The so­called Half­Blood Prince.’

‘Oh, not again,’ he groaned. ‘Will you please drop it?’

He had not dared to re­turn to the Room of Re­quire­ment to re­trieve his book, and his per­for­mance in Po­tions was suf­fer­ing ac­cord­ing­ly (though Slughorn, who ap­proved of Gin­ny, had joc­ular­ly at­trib­ut­ed this to Har­ry be­ing lovesick). But Har­ry was sure that Snape had not yet giv­en up hope of lay­ing hands on the Prince’s book, and was de­ter­mined to leave it where it was while Snape re­mained on the look­out.

‘I’m not drop­ping it,’ said Hermione firm­ly, ‘un­til you’ve heard me out. Now, I’ve been try­ing to find out a bit about who might make a hob­by of in­vent­ing Dark spells -’

‘He didn’t make a hob­by of it -’

‘He, he - who says it’s a he?’

‘We’ve been through this,’ said Har­ry cross­ly. ‘Prince, Hermione, Prince!’

‘Right!’ said Hermione, red patch­es blaz­ing in her cheeks as she pulled a very old piece of newsprint out of her pock­et and slammed it down on the ta­ble in front of Har­ry. ‘Look at that! Look at the pic­ture!’

Har­ry picked up the crum­bling piece of pa­per and stared at the mov­ing pho­to­graph, yel­lowed with age; Ron leaned over for a look, too. The pic­ture showed a skin­ny girl of around fif­teen. She was not pret­ty; she looked si­mul­ta­ne­ous­ly cross and sullen, with heavy brows and a long, pal­lid face. Un­der­neath the pho­to­graph was the cap­tion: Eileen Prince, Cap­tain of the Hog­warts Gob­stones Team.

‘So?’ said Har­ry, scan­ning the short news item to which the pic­ture be­longed; it was a rather dull sto­ry about in­ter­school com­pe­ti­tions.

‘Her name was Eileen Prince. Prince, Har­ry.’

They looked at each oth­er and Har­ry re­alised what Hermione was try­ing to say. He burst out laugh­ing.

‘No way.’

‘What?’

‘You think she was the Half­Blood …? Oh, come on.’

‘Well, why not? Har­ry, there aren’t any re­al princes in the wiz­ard­ing world! It’s ei­ther a nick­name, a made­up ti­tle some­body’s giv­en them­selves, or it could be their ac­tu­al name, couldn’t it? No, lis­ten! If, say, her fa­ther was a wiz­ard

whose sur­name was “Prince”, and her moth­er was a Mug­gle, then that would make her a “half­blood Prince”!’

‘Yeah, very in­ge­nious, Hermione …’

‘But it would! Maybe she was proud of be­ing half a Prince!’

‘Lis­ten, Hermione, I can tell it’s not a girl. I can just tell.’

The truth is that you don’t think a girl would have been clever enough,’ said Hermione an­gri­ly.

‘How can I have hung round with you for five years and not think girls are clever?’ said Har­ry, stung by this. ‘It’s the way he writes. I just know the Prince was a bloke, I can tell. This girl hasn’t got any­thing to do with it. Where did you get this, any­way?’

‘The li­brary,’ said Hermione, pre­dictably. There’s a whole col­lec­tion of old Prophets up there. Well, I’m go­ing to find out more about Eileen Prince if I can.’

‘En­joy your­self,’ said Har­ry ir­ri­ta­bly.

‘I will,’ said Hermione. ‘And the first place I’ll look,’ she shot at him, as she reached the por­trait hole, ‘is records of old Po­tions awards!’

Har­ry scowled af­ter her for a mo­ment, then con­tin­ued his con­tem­pla­tion of the dark­en­ing sky.

‘She’s just nev­er got over you out­per­form­ing her in Po­tions,’ said Ron, re­turn­ing to his copy of One Thou­sand Mag­ical Herbs and Fun­gi.

‘You don’t think I’m mad, want­ing that book back, do you?’

‘Course not,’ said Ron ro­bust­ly. ‘He was a ge­nius, the Prince. Any­way … with­out his be­zoar tip …’ he drew his fin­ger sig­nif­icant­ly across his own throat, ‘I wouldn’t be here to dis­cuss it, would I? I mean, I’m not say­ing that spell you used on Mal­foy was great -’

‘Nor am I,’ said Har­ry quick­ly.

‘But he healed all right, didn’t he? Back on his feet in no time.’

‘Yeah,’ said Har­ry; this was per­fect­ly true, al­though his con­sci­ence squirmed slight­ly all the same. Thanks to Snape …’

‘You still got de­ten­tion with Snape this Sat­ur­day?’ Ron con­tin­ued.

‘Yeah, and the Sat­ur­day af­ter that, and the Sat­ur­day af­ter that,’ sighed Har­ry. ‘And he’s hint­ing now that if I don’t get all the box­es done by the end of term, we’ll car­ry on next year.’

He was find­ing these de­ten­tions par­tic­ular­ly irk­some be­cause they cut in­to the al­ready lim­it­ed time he could have been spend­ing with Gin­ny. In­deed, he had fre­quent­ly won­dered late­ly whether Snape did not know this, for he was keep­ing Har­ry lat­er and lat­er ev­ery time, while mak­ing point­ed asides about Har­ry hav­ing to miss the good weath­er and the var­ied op­por­tu­ni­ties it of­fered.

Har­ry was shak­en from these bit­ter re­flec­tions by the ap­pear­an­ce at his side of Jim­my Peakes, who was hold­ing out a scroll of parch­ment.

‘Thanks, Jim­my … hey, it’s from Dum­ble­dore!’ said Har­ry ex­cit­ed­ly, un­rolling the parch­ment and scan­ning it. ‘He wants me to go to his of­fice as quick as 1 can!’

They stared at each oth­er.

‘Blimey,’ whis­pered Ron. ‘You don’t reck­on … he hasn’t found …?’

‘Bet­ter go and see, hadn’t I?’ said Har­ry, jump­ing to his feet.

He hur­ried out of the com­mon room and along the sev­enth floor as fast as he could, pass­ing no­body but Peeves, who swooped past in the op­po­site di­rec­tion, throw­ing bits of chalk at Har­ry in a rou­tine sort of way and cack­ling loud­ly as he dodged Har­ry’s de­fen­sive jinx. Once Peeves had van­ished, there was si­lence in the cor­ri­dors; with on­ly fif­teen min­utes left un­til cur­few, most peo­ple had al­ready re­turned to their com­mon rooms.

And then Har­ry heard a scream and a crash. He stopped in his tracks, lis­ten­ing.

‘How - dare - you - aaaaargh!’

The noise was com­ing from a cor­ri­dor near­by; Har­ry sprint­ed to­wards it, his wand at the ready, hur­tled round an­oth­er cor­ner and saw Pro­fes­sor Trelawney sprawled up­on the floor, her head cov­ered in one of her many shawls, sev­er­al sher­ry bot­tles ly­ing be­side her, one bro­ken.

‘Pro­fes­sor -’

Har­ry hur­ried for­wards and helped Pro­fes­sor Trelawney to her feet. Some of her glit­ter­ing beads had be­come en­tan­gled with her glass­es. She hic­coughed loud­ly, pat­ted her hair and pulled her­self up on Har­ry’s help­ing arm.

‘What hap­pened, Pro­fes­sor?’

‘You may well ask!’ she said shril­ly. ‘I was strolling along, brood­ing up­on cer­tain Dark por­tents 1 hap­pen to have glimpsed …’

But Har­ry was not pay­ing much at­ten­tion. He had just no­ticed where they were stand­ing: there on the right was the tapestry of danc­ing trolls and, on the left, that smooth­ly im­pen­etra­ble stretch of stone wall that con­cealed -

‘Pro­fes­sor, were you try­ing to get in­to the Room of Re­quire­ment?’

‘… omens I have been vouch­safed - what?’

She looked sud­den­ly shifty.

The Room of Re­quire­ment,’ re­peat­ed Har­ry. ‘Were you try­ing to get in there?’

‘I - well - I didn’t know stu­dents knew about -’

‘Not all of them do,’ said Har­ry. ‘But what hap­pened? You screamed … it sound­ed as though you were hurt…’

‘I - well,’ said Pro­fes­sor Trelawney, draw­ing her shawls around her de­fen­sive­ly and star­ing down at him with her vast­ly mag­ni­fied eyes. ‘I wished to - ah - de­posit cer­tain – um - per­son­al items in the Room …’ And she mut­tered some­thing about ‘nasty ac­cu­sa­tions’.

‘Right,’ said Har­ry, glanc­ing down at the sher­ry bot­tles. ‘But you couldn’t get in and hide them?’

He found this very odd; the Room had opened for him, af­ter all, when he had want­ed to hide the Half­Blood Prince’s book.

‘Oh, I got in all right,’ said Pro­fes­sor Trelawney, glar­ing at the wall. ‘But there was some­body al­ready in there.’

‘Some­body in -? Who?’ de­mand­ed Har­ry. ‘Who was in there?’

‘ ? have no idea,’ said Pro­fes­sor Trelawney, look­ing slight­ly tak­en aback at the ur­gen­cy in Har­ry’s voice. ‘I walked in­to the Room and I heard a voice, which has nev­er hap­pened be­fore in all my years of hid­ing - of us­ing the Room, I mean.’

‘A voice? Say­ing what?’

‘I don’t know that it was say­ing any­thing,’ said Pro­fes­sor Trelawney. ‘It was … whoop­ing.’

‘Whoop­ing?’

‘Glee­ful­ly,’ she said, nod­ding.

Har­ry stared at her.

‘Was it male or fe­male?’

‘ ? would haz­ard a guess at male,’ said Pro­fes­sor Trelawney.

‘And it sound­ed hap­py?’

‘Very hap­py,’ said Pro­fes­sor Trelawney snif­fi­ly.

‘As though it was cel­ebrat­ing?’

‘Most def­inite­ly.’

‘And then -?’

‘And then I called out, “Who’s there?”‘

‘You couldn’t have found out who it was with­out ask­ing?’ Har­ry asked her, slight­ly frus­trat­ed.

‘The In­ner Eye,’ said Pro­fes­sor Trelawney with dig­ni­ty, straight­en­ing her shawls and many strands of glit­ter­ing beads, ‘was fixed up­on mat­ters well out­side the mun­dane realms of whoop­ing voic­es.’

‘Right,’ said Har­ry hasti­ly; he had heard about Pro­fes­sor Trelawney’s In­ner Eye all too of­ten be­fore. ‘And did the voice say who was there?’

‘No, it did not,’ she said. ‘Ev­ery­thing went pitch black and the next thing I knew, I was be­ing hurled head­first out of the Room!’

‘And you didn’t see that com­ing?’ said Har­ry, un­able to help him­self.

‘No, I did not, as I say, it was pitch -’ She stopped and glared at him sus­pi­cious­ly.

‘I think you’d bet­ter tell Pro­fes­sor Dum­ble­dore,’ said Har­ry. ‘He ought to know Mal­foy’s cel­ebrat­ing - I mean, that some­one threw you out of the Room.’

To his sur­prise, Pro­fes­sor Trelawney drew her­self up at this sug­ges­tion, look­ing haughty.

The Head­mas­ter has in­ti­mat­ed that he would pre­fer few­er vis­its from me,’ she said cold­ly. I am not one to press my com­pa­ny up­on those who do not val­ue it. If Dum­ble­dore choos­es to ig­nore the warn­in­gs the cards show -’

Her bony hand closed sud­den­ly around Har­ry’s wrist.

‘Again and again, no mat­ter how I lay them out -’

And she pulled a card dra­mat­ical­ly from un­der­neath her shawls.

‘- the light­ningstruck tow­er,’ she whis­pered. ‘Cala­mi­ty. Dis­as­ter. Com­ing near­er all the time …’

‘Right,’ said Har­ry again. ‘Well … I still think you should tell Dum­ble­dore about this voice and ev­ery­thing go­ing dark and be­ing thrown out of the Room …’

‘You think so?’ Pro­fes­sor Trelawney seemed to con­sid­er the mat­ter for a mo­ment, but Har­ry could tell that she liked the idea of retelling her lit­tle ad­ven­ture.

‘I’m go­ing to see him right now,’ said Har­ry. ‘I’ve got a meet­ing with him. We could go to­geth­er.’

‘Oh, well, in that case,’ said Pro­fes­sor Trelawney with a smile. She bent down, scooped up her sher­ry bot­tles and dumped them un­cer­emo­ni­ous­ly in a large blue and white vase stand­ing in a near­by niche.

‘I miss hav­ing you in my class­es, Har­ry,’ she said soul­ful­ly, as they set off to­geth­er. ‘You were nev­er much of a Seer … but you were a won­der­ful Ob­ject…’

Har­ry did not re­ply; he had loathed be­ing the Ob­ject of Pro­fes­sor Trelawney’s con­tin­ual pre­dic­tions of doom.

‘I am afraid,’ she went on, ‘that the nag - I’m sor­ry, the cen­taur - knows noth­ing of car­toman­cy. I asked him - one Seer to an­oth­er - had he not, too, sensed the dis­tant vi­bra­tions of com­ing catas­tro­phe? But he seemed to find me al­most com­ical. Yes, com­ical!’

Her voice rose rather hys­ter­ical­ly and Har­ry caught a pow­er­ful whiff of sher­ry even though the bot­tles had been left be­hind.

‘Per­haps the horse has heard peo­ple say that I have not in­her­it­ed my great­great­grand­moth­er’s gift. Those ru­mours have been bandied about by the jeal­ous for years. You know what I say to such peo­ple, Har­ry? Would Dum­ble­dore have let me teach at this great school, put so much trust in me all these years, had I not proved my­self to him?’

Har­ry mum­bled some­thing in­dis­tinct.

‘I well re­mem­ber my first in­ter­view with Dum­ble­dore,’ went on Pro­fes­sor Trelawney, in throaty tones. ‘He was deeply im­pressed, of course, deeply im­pressed … I was stay­ing at the Hog’s Head, which I do not ad­vise, in­ci­den­tal­ly - bed bugs, dear boy - but funds were low. Dum­ble­dore did me the cour­tesy of call­ing up­on me in my room at the inn. He ques­tioned me … I must con­fess that, at first, I thought he seemed illd­is­posed to­wards Div­ina­tion … and I re­mem­ber I was start­ing to feel a lit­tle odd, I had not eat­en much that day … but then …’

And now Har­ry was pay­ing at­ten­tion prop­er­ly for the first time, for he knew what had hap­pened then: Pro­fes­sor Trelawney had made the prophe­cy that had al­tered the course of his whole life, the prophe­cy about him and Volde­mort.

‘… but then we were rude­ly in­ter­rupt­ed by Severus Snape!’

‘What?’

‘Yes, there was a com­mo­tion out­side the door and it flew open, and there was that rather un­couth bar­man stand­ing with Snape, who was waf­fling about hav­ing come the wrong way up the stairs, al­though I’m afraid that I my­self rather thought he had been ap­pre­hend­ed eaves­drop­ping on my in­ter­view with Dum­ble­dore - you see, he him­self was seek­ing a job at the time, and no doubt hoped to pick up tips! Well, af­ter that, you know, Dum­ble­dore seemed much more dis­posed to give me a job, and I could not help think­ing, Har­ry, that it was be­cause he ap­pre­ci­at­ed the stark con­trast be­tween my own unas­sum­ing man­ners and qui­et tal­ent, com­pared to the push­ing, thrust­ing young man who was pre­pared to lis­ten at key­holes - Har­ry, dear?’

She looked back over her shoul­der, hav­ing on­ly just re­al­ised that Har­ry was no longer with her; he had stopped walk­ing and they were now ten feet from each oth­er.

‘Har­ry?’ she re­peat­ed un­cer­tain­ly.

Per­haps his face was white, to make her look so con­cerned and fright­ened. Har­ry was stand­ing stock­still as waves of shock crashed over him, wave af­ter wave, oblit­er­at­ing ev­ery­thing ex­cept the in­for­ma­tion that had been kept from him for so long …

It was Snape who had over­heard the prophe­cy. It was Snape who had car­ried the news of the prophe­cy to Volde­mort. Snape and Pe­ter Pet­ti­grew to­geth­er had sent Volde­mort hunt­ing af­ter Lily and James and their son …

Noth­ing else mat­tered to Har­ry just now.

‘Har­ry?’ said Pro­fes­sor Trelawney again. ‘Har­ry - I thought we were go­ing to see the Head­mas­ter to­geth­er?’

‘You stay here,’ said Har­ry through numb lips.

‘But, dear … I was go­ing to tell him how I was as­sault­ed in the Room of-’

‘You stay here!’ Har­ry re­peat­ed an­gri­ly.

She looked alarmed as he ran past her, round the cor­ner in­to Dum­ble­dore’s cor­ri­dor, where the lone gar­goyle stood sen­try. Har­ry shout­ed the pass­word at the gar­goyle and ran up the mov­ing spi­ral stair­case three steps at a time. He did not knock up­on Dum­ble­dore’s door, he ham­mered; and the calm voice an­swered ‘En­ter’ af­ter Har­ry had al­ready flung him­self in­to the room.

Fawkes the phoenix looked round, his bright black eyes gleam­ing with re­flect­ed gold from the sun­set be­yond the win­dow. Dum­ble­dore was stand­ing at the win­dow look­ing out at the grounds, a long, black trav­el­ling cloak in his arms.

‘Well, Har­ry, I promised that you could come with me.’

For a mo­ment or two, Har­ry did not un­der­stand; the con­ver­sa­tion with Trelawney had driv­en ev­ery­thing else out of his head and his brain seemed to be mov­ing very slow­ly.

‘Come … with you … ?’

‘On­ly if you wish it, of course.’

‘If I…’

And then Har­ry re­mem­bered why he had been ea­ger to come to Dum­ble­dore’s of­fice in the first place.

‘You’ve found one? You’ve found a Hor­crux?’

‘I be­lieve so.’

Rage and re­sent­ment fought shock and ex­cite­ment: for sev­er­al mo­ments, Har­ry could not speak.

‘It is nat­ural to be afraid,’ said Dum­ble­dore.

‘I’m not scared!’ said Har­ry at once, and it was per­fect­ly

true; fear was one emo­tion he was not feel­ing at all. ‘Which Hor­crux is it? Where is it?’

‘I am not sure which it is - though I think we can rule out the snake - but I be­lieve it to be hid­den in a cave on the coast many miles from here, a cave I have been try­ing to lo­cate for a very long time: the cave in which Tom Rid­dle once ter­ror­ised two chil­dren from his or­phan­age on their an­nu­al trip; you re­mem­ber?’

‘Yes,’ said Har­ry. ‘How is it pro­tect­ed?’

‘I do not know; I have sus­pi­cions that may be en­tire­ly wrong.’ Dum­ble­dore hes­itat­ed, then said, ‘Har­ry, I promised you that you could come with me, and I stand by that prom­ise, but it would be very wrong of me not to warn you that this will be ex­ceed­ing­ly dan­ger­ous.’

‘I’m com­ing,’ said Har­ry, al­most be­fore Dum­ble­dore had fin­ished speak­ing. Boil­ing with anger at Snape, his de­sire to do some­thing des­per­ate and risky had in­creased ten­fold in the last few min­utes. This seemed to show on Har­ry’s face, for Dum­ble­dore moved away from the win­dow, and looked more close­ly at Har­ry, a slight crease be­tween his sil­ver eye­brows.

‘What has hap­pened to you?’

‘Noth­ing,’ lied Har­ry prompt­ly.

‘What has up­set you?’

‘I’m not up­set.’

‘Har­ry, you were nev­er a good Oc­clu­mens -’

The word was the spark that ig­nit­ed Har­ry’s fury.

‘Snape!’ he said, very loud­ly, and Fawkes gave a soft squawk be­hind them. ‘Snape’s what’s hap­pened! He told Volde­mort about the prophe­cy, it was him, he lis­tened out­side the door, Trelawney told me!’

Dum­ble­dore’s ex­pres­sion did not change, but Har­ry thought his face whitened un­der the bloody tinge cast by the set­ting sun. For a long mo­ment, Dum­ble­dore said noth­ing.

‘When did you find out about this?’ he asked at last.

‘Just now!’ said Many, who was re­frain­ing from yelling with enor­mous dif­fi­cul­ty. And then, sud­den­ly, he could not stop him­self. ‘AND YOU LET HIM TEACH HERE AND HE TOLD VOLDE­MORT TO GO AF­TER MY MUM AND DAD!’

Breath­ing hard as though he were fight­ing, Har­ry turned away from Dum­ble­dore, who still had not moved a mus­cle, and paced up and down the study, rub­bing his knuck­les in his hand and ex­er­cis­ing ev­ery last bit of re­straint to pre­vent him­self knock­ing things over. He want­ed to rage and storm at Dum­ble­dore, but he al­so want­ed to go with him to try and de­stroy the Hor­crux; he want­ed to tell him that he was a fool­ish old man for trust­ing Snape, but he was ter­ri­fied that Dum­ble­dore would not take him along un­less he mas­tered his anger …

‘Har­ry,’ said Dum­ble­dore qui­et­ly. ‘Please lis­ten to me.’

It was as dif­fi­cult to stop his re­lent­less pac­ing as to re­frain from shout­ing. Har­ry paused, bit­ing his lip, and looked in­to Dum­ble­dore’s lined face.

‘Pro­fes­sor Snape made a ter­ri­ble -’

‘Don’t tell me it was a mis­take, sir, he was lis­ten­ing at the door!’

‘Please let me fin­ish.’ Dum­ble­dore wait­ed un­til Har­ry had nod­ded curt­ly, then went on. ‘Pro­fes­sor Snape made a ter­ri­ble mis­take. He was still in Lord Volde­mort’s em­ploy on the night he heard the first half of Pro­fes­sor Trelawney’s prophe­cy. Nat­ural­ly, he has­tened to tell his mas­ter what he had heard, for it con­cerned his mas­ter most deeply. But he did not know - he had no pos­si­ble way of know­ing - which boy Volde­mort would hunt from then on­wards, or that the par­ents he would de­stroy in his mur­der­ous quest were peo­ple that Pro­fes­sor Snape knew, that they were your moth­er and fa­ther -’

Har­ry let out a yell of mirth­less laugh­ter.

‘He hat­ed my dad like he hat­ed Sir­ius! Haven’t you no­ticed, Pro­fes­sor, how the peo­ple Snape hates tend to end up dead?’

‘You have no idea of the re­morse Pro­fes­sor Snape felt when he re­alised how Lord Volde­mort had in­ter­pret­ed the prophe­cy, Har­ry. I be­lieve it to be the great­est re­gret of his life and the rea­son that he re­turned -’

‘But he’s a very good Oc­clu­mens, isn’t he, sir?’ said Har­ry, whose voice was shak­ing with the ef­fort of keep­ing it steady. ‘And isn’t Volde­mort con­vinced that Snape’s on his side, even now? Pro­fes­sor … how can you be sure Snape’s on our side?’

Dum­ble­dore did not speak for a mo­ment; he looked as though he was try­ing to make up his mind about some­thing. At last he said, ‘I am sure. I trust Severus Snape com­plete­ly.’

Har­ry breathed deeply for a few mo­ments in an ef­fort to steady him­self. It did not work.

‘Well, I don’t!’ he said, as loud­ly as be­fore. ‘He’s up to some­thing with Dra­co Mal­foy right now, right un­der your nose, and you still -’

‘We have dis­cussed this, Har­ry,’ said Dum­ble­dore, and now he sound­ed stern again. ‘I have told you my views.’

‘You’re leav­ing the school tonight and I’ll bet you haven’t even con­sid­ered that Snape and Mal­foy might de­cide to -’

To what?’ asked Dum­ble­dore, his eye­brows raised. ‘What is it that you sus­pect them of do­ing, pre­cise­ly?’

‘I … they’re up to some­thing!’ said Har­ry and his hands curled in­to fists as he said it. ‘Pro­fes­sor Trelawney was just in the Room of Re­quire­ment, try­ing to hide her sher­ry bot­tles, and she heard Mal­foy whoop­ing, cel­ebrat­ing! He’s try­ing to mend some­thing dan­ger­ous in there and if you ask me he’s fixed it at last and you’re about to just walk out of school * with­out -’

‘Enough,’ said Dum­ble­dore. He said it quite calm­ly, and yet Har­ry fell silent at once; he knew that he had fi­nal­ly crossed some in­vis­ible line. ‘Do you think that I have once left the school un­pro­tect­ed dur­ing my ab­sences this year? I have not. Tonight, when I leave, there will again be ad­di­tion­al pro­tec­tion in place. Please do not sug­gest that I do not take the safe­ty of my stu­dents se­ri­ous­ly, Har­ry.’

‘I didn’t -’ mum­bled Har­ry, a lit­tle abashed, but Dum­ble­dore cut across him.

‘ ? do not wish to dis­cuss the mat­ter any fur­ther.’

Har­ry bit back his re­tort, scared that he had gone too far, that he had ru­in­ed his chance of ac­com­pa­ny­ing Dum­ble­dore, but Dum­ble­dore went on, ‘Do you wish to come with me tonight?’

‘Yes,’ said Har­ry at once.

‘Very well, then: lis­ten.’

Dum­ble­dore drew him­self up to his full height.

‘I take you with me on one con­di­tion: that you obey any com­mand I might give you at once, and with­out ques­tion.’

‘Of course.’

‘Be sure to un­der­stand me, Har­ry. I mean that you must fol­low even such or­ders as “run”, “hide” or “go back”. Do I have your word?’

‘I - yes, of course.’

‘If 1 tell you to hide, you will do so?’

‘Yes.’

‘If I tell you to flee, you will obey?’

‘Yes.’

‘If I tell you to leave me, and save your­self, you will do as I tell you?’

‘I -’

‘Har­ry?’

They looked at each oth­er for a mo­ment.

‘Yes, sir.’

‘Very good. Then I wish you to go and fetch your Cloak and meet me in the En­trance Hall in five min­utes’ time.’

Dum­ble­dore turned back to look out of the fiery win­dow; the sun was now a ru­byred glare along the hori­zon. Har­ry walked quick­ly from the of­fice and down the spi­ral stair­case. His mind was odd­ly clear all of a sud­den. He knew what to do.

Ron and Hermione were sit­ting to­geth­er in the com­mon room when he came back. ‘What does Dum­ble­dore want?’ Hermione said at once. ‘Har­ry, are you OK?’ she added anx­ious­ly.

‘I’m fine,’ said Har­ry short­ly, rac­ing past them. He dashed up the stairs and in­to his dor­mi­to­ry, where he flung open his trunk and pulled out the Ma­raud­er’s Map and a pair of balledup socks. Then he sped back down the stairs and in­to the com­mon room, skid­ding to a halt where Ron and Hermione sat, look­ing stunned.

‘I haven’t got much time,’ Har­ry pant­ed, ‘Dum­ble­dore thinks I’m get­ting my In­vis­ibil­ity Cloak. Lis­ten …’

Quick­ly he told them where he was go­ing, and why. He did not pause ei­ther for Hermione’s gasps of hor­ror or for Ron’s hasty ques­tions; they could work out the fin­er de­tails for them­selves lat­er.

‘… so you see what this means?’ Har­ry fin­ished at a gal­lop. ‘Dum­ble­dore won’t be here tonight, so Mal­foy’s go­ing to have an­oth­er clear shot at what­ev­er he’s up to. No, lis­ten to me!” he hissed an­gri­ly, as both Ron and Hermione showed ev­ery sign of in­ter­rupt­ing. ‘I know it was Mal­foy cel­ebrat­ing in the Room of Re­quire­ment. Here -’ He shoved the Ma­raud­er’s Map in­to Hermione’s hand. ‘You’ve got to watch him and you’ve got to watch Snape, too. Use any­one else who you can rus­tle up from the DA. Hermione, those con­tact Galleons will still work, right? Dum­ble­dore says he’s put ex­tra pro­tec­tion in the school, but if Snape’s in­volved, he’ll know what Dum­ble­dore’s pro­tec­tion is, and how to avoid it - but he won’t be ex­pect­ing you lot to be on the watch, will he?’

‘Har­ry -’ be­gan Hermione, her eyes huge with fear.

‘ ? haven’t got time to ar­gue,’ said Har­ry curt­ly. Take this as well -’ He thrust the socks in­to Ron’s hands.

‘Thanks,’ said Ron. ‘Er - why do I need socks?’

‘You need what’s wrapped in them, it’s the Fe­lix Fe­li­cis. Share it be­tween your­selves and Gin­ny too. Say good­bye to her from me. I’d bet­ter go, Dum­ble­dore’s wait­ing -’

‘No!’ said Hermione, as Ron un­wrapped the tiny lit­tle bot­tle of gold­en po­tion, look­ing awestruck. ‘We don’t want it, you take it, who knows what you’re go­ing to be fac­ing?’

‘I’Il be fine, I’ll be with Dum­ble­dore,’ said Har­ry. ‘I want to know you lot are OK … don’t look like that, Hermione, I’ll see you lat­er

And he was off, hur­ry­ing back through the por­trait hole to­wards the En­trance Hall.

Dum­ble­dore was wait­ing be­side the oak­en front doors. He turned as Har­ry came skid­ding out on to the top­most stone step, pant­ing hard, a sear­ing stitch in his side.

‘I would like you to wear your Cloak, please,’ said Dum­ble­dore, and he wait­ed un­til Har­ry had thrown it on be­fore say­ing, ‘Very good. Shall we go?’

Dum­ble­dore set off at once down the stone steps, his own trav­el­ling cloak bare­ly stir­ring in the still sum­mer air. Har­ry hur­ried along­side him un­der the In­vis­ibil­ity Cloak, still pant­ing and sweat­ing rather a lot.

‘But what will peo­ple think when they see you leav­ing, Pro­fes­sor?’ Har­ry asked, his mind on Mal­foy and Snape.

That I am off in­to Hogsmeade for a drink,’ said Dum­ble­dore light­ly. ‘I some­times of­fer Ros­mer­ta my cus­tom, or else vis­it the Hog’s Head … or I ap­pear to. It is as good a way as any of dis­guis­ing one’s true des­ti­na­tion.’

They made their way down the drive in the gath­er­ing twi­light. The air was full of the smells of warm grass, lake wa­ter and wood smoke from Ha­grid’s cab­in. It was dif­fi­cult to be­lieve that they were head­ing for any­thing dan­ger­ous or fright­en­ing.

‘Pro­fes­sor,’ said Har­ry qui­et­ly, as the gates at the bot­tom of the drive came in­to view, ‘will we be Ap­pa­rat­ing?’

‘Yes,’ said Dum­ble­dore. ‘You can Ap­pa­rate now, I be­lieve?’

‘Yes,’ said Har­ry, ‘but I haven’t got a li­cence.’

He felt it best to be hon­est; what if he spoiled ev­ery­thing by turn­ing up a hun­dred miles from where he was sup­posed to go?

‘No mat­ter,’ said Dum­ble­dore, ‘I can as­sist you again.’

They turned out of the gates in­to the twilit, de­sert­ed lane to Hogsmeade. Dark­ness de­scend­ed fast as they walked and by the time they reached the High Street night was falling in earnest. Lights twin­kled from win­dows over shops and as they neared the Three Broom­sticks they heard rau­cous shout­ing.

‘- and stay out!’ shout­ed Madam Ros­mer­ta, forcibly eject­ing a grub­by­look­ing wiz­ard. ‘Oh, hel­lo, Al­bus … you’re out late …’

‘Good evening, Ros­mer­ta, good evening … for­give me, I’m off to the Hog’s Head … no of­fence, but I feel like a qui­eter at­mo­sphere tonight…’

A minute lat­er they turned the cor­ner in­to the side street where the Hog’s Head’s sign creaked a lit­tle, though there was no breeze. In con­trast to the Three Broom­sticks, the pub ap­peared to be com­plete­ly emp­ty.

‘It will not be nec­es­sary for us to en­ter,’ mut­tered Dum­ble­dore, glanc­ing around. ‘As long as no­body sees us go … now place your hand up­on my arm, Har­ry. There is no need to grip too hard, I am mere­ly guid­ing you. On the count of three - one … two … three …’

Har­ry turned. At once, there was that hor­ri­ble sen­sa­tion that he was be­ing squeezed through a thick rub­ber tube; he could not draw breath, ev­ery part of him was be­ing com­pressed al­most past en­du­rance and then, just when he thought he must suf­fo­cate, the in­vis­ible bands seemed to burst open, and he was stand­ing in cool dark­ness, breath­ing in lung­fuls of fresh, salty air.
