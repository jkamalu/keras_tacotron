Chapter 4: Horace Slughorn


De­spite the fact that he had spent ev­ery wak­ing mo­ment of the past few days hop­ing des­per­ate­ly that Dum­ble­dore would in­deed come to fetch him, Har­ry felt dis­tinct­ly awk­ward as they set off down Priv­et Drive to­geth­er. He had nev­er had a prop­er con­ver­sa­tion with the head­mas­ter out­side of Hog­warts be­fore; there was usu­al­ly a desk be­tween them. The mem­ory of their last faceto­face en­counter kept in­trud­ing too, and it rather height­ened Har­ry’s sense of em­bar­rass­ment; he had shout­ed a lot on that oc­ca­sion, not to men­tion done his best to smash sev­er­al of Dum­ble­dore’s most prized pos­ses­sions.

Dum­ble­dore, how­ev­er, seemed com­plete­ly re­laxed.

“Keep your wand at the ready, Har­ry,” he said bright­ly.

“But I thought I’m not al­lowed to use mag­ic out­side school, sir?”

“If there is an at­tack,” said Dum­ble­dore, “I give you per­mis­sion to use any coun­ter­jinx or curse that might oc­cur to you. How­ev­er, I do not think you need wor­ry about be­ing at­tacked tonight.”

“Why not, sir?”

“You are with me,” said Dum­ble­dore sim­ply. “This will do, Har­ry.”

He came to an abrupt halt at the end of Priv­et Drive.

“You have not, of course, passed your Ap­pari­tion Test,” he said.

“No,” said Har­ry. “I thought you had to be sev­en­teen?”

“You do,” said Dum­ble­dore. “So you will need to hold on to my arm very tight­ly. My left, if you don’t mind — as you have no­ticed, my wand arm is a lit­tle frag­ile at the mo­ment.”

Har­ry gripped Dum­ble­dore’s prof­fered fore­arm.

“Very good,” said Dum­ble­dore. “Well, here we go.”

Har­ry felt Dum­ble­dore’s arm twist away from him and re­dou­bled his grip; the next thing he knew, ev­ery­thing went black; he was be­ing pressed very hard from all di­rec­tions; he could not breathe, there were iron bands tight­en­ing around his chest; his eye­balls were be­ing forced back in­to his head; his eardrums were be­ing pushed deep­er in­to his skull and then —-

He gulped great lung­fulls of cold night air and opened his stream­ing eyes. He felt as though he had just been forced through a very tight rub­ber tube. It was a few sec­onds be­fore he re­al­ized that Priv­et Drive had van­ished. He and Dum­ble­dore were now stand­ing in what ap­peared to be a de­sert­ed vil­lage square, in the cen­ter of which stood an old war memo­ri­al and a few bench­es. His com­pre­hen­sion catch­ing up with his sens­es, Har­ry re­al­ized that he had just Ap­pa­rat­ed for the first time in his life.

“Are you all right?” asked Dum­ble­dore, look­ing down at him so­lic­itous­ly. “The sen­sa­tion does take some get­ting used to.”

“I’m fine,” said Har­ry, rub­bing his ears, which felt as though they had left Priv­et Drive rather re­luc­tant­ly. “But I think I might pre­fer brooms…”

Dum­ble­dore smiled, drew his trav­el­ing cloak a lit­tle more light­ly around his neck, and said, “This way.”

He set off at a brisk pace, past an emp­ty inn and a few hous­es. Ac­cord­ing to a clock on a near­by church, it was al­most mid­night.

“So tell me, Har­ry,” said Dum­ble­dore. “Your scar… has it been hurt­ing at all?”

Har­ry raised a hand un­con­scious­ly to his fore­head and rubbed i he light­ning­shaped mark.

“No,” he said, “and I’ve been won­der­ing about that. I thought it would be burn­ing all the time now Volde­mort’s get­ting so pow­er­ful again.”

He glanced up at Dum­ble­dore and saw that he was wear­ing a sat­is­fied ex­pres­sion.

“I, on the oth­er hand, thought oth­er­wise,” said Dum­ble­dore. “Lord Volde­mort has fi­nal­ly re­al­ized the dan­ger­ous ac­cess to his thoughts and feel­in­gs you have been en­joy­ing. It ap­pears that he is now em­ploy­ing Oc­clu­men­cy against you.”

“Well, I’m not com­plain­ing,” said Har­ry, who missed nei­ther the dis­turb­ing dreams nor the startling flash­es of in­sight in­to Volde­mort’s mind.

They turned a cor­ner, pass­ing a tele­phone box and a bus shel­ter. Har­ry looked side­ways at Dum­ble­dore again. “Pro­fes­sor?”

“Har­ry?”

“Er — where ex­act­ly are we?”

“This, Har­ry, is the charm­ing vil­lage of Budleigh Bab­ber­ton.”

“And what are we do­ing here?”

“Ah yes, of course, I haven’t told you,” said Dum­ble­dore. “Well, I have lost count of the num­ber of times I have said this in re­cent years, but we are, once again, one mem­ber of staff short. We are here to per­suade an old col­league of mine to come out of re­tire­ment and re­turn to Hog­warts.”

“How can I help with that, sir?”

“Oh, I think we’ll find a use for you,” said Dum­ble­dore vague­ly. “Left here, Har­ry.”

They pro­ceed­ed up a steep, nar­row street lined with hous­es. All the win­dows were dark. The odd chill that had lain over Priv­et Drive for two weeks per­sist­ed here too. Think­ing of de­men­tors, Har­ry cast a look over his shoul­der and grasped his wand re­as­sur­ing­ly in his pock­et.

“Pro­fes­sor, why couldn’t we just Ap­pa­rate di­rect­ly in­to your old col­league’s house?”

“Be­cause it would be quite as rude as kick­ing down the front door,” said Dum­ble­dore. “Cour­tesy dic­tates that we of­fer fel­low wiz­ards the op­por­tu­ni­ty of de­ny­ing us en­try. In any case, most Wiz­ard­ing dwellings are mag­ical­ly pro­tect­ed from un­want­ed Ap­pa­ra­tors. At Hog­warts, for in­stance —”

“— you can’t Ap­pa­rate any­where in­side the build­in­gs or grounds,” said Har­ry quick­ly. “Hermione Granger told me.”

“And she is quite right. We turn left again.”

The church clock chimed mid­night be­hind them. Har­ry won­dered why Dum­ble­dore did not con­sid­er it rude to call on his old col­league so late, but now that con­ver­sa­tion had been es­tab­lished, he had more press­ing ques­tions to ask.

“Sir, I saw in the Dai­ly Prophet that Fudge has been sacked…”

“Cor­rect,” said Dum­ble­dore, now turn­ing up a steep side street. “He has been re­placed, as ] am sure you al­so saw, by Ru­fus Scrim­geour, who used to be Head of the Au­ror of­fice.”

“Is he… Do you think he’s good?” asked Har­ry.

“An in­ter­est­ing ques­tion,” said Dum­ble­dore. “He is able, cer­tain­ly. A more de­ci­sive and force­ful per­son­al­ity than Cor­nelius.”

“Yes, but I meant —”

“I know what you meant. Ru­fus is a man of ac­tion and, hav­ing fought Dark wiz­ards for most of his work­ing life, does not un­deres­ti­mate Lord Volde­mort.”

Har­ry wait­ed, but Dum­ble­dore did not say any­thing about the dis­agree­ment with Scrim­geour that the Dai­ly Prophet had re­port­ed, and he did not have the nerve to pur­sue the sub­ject, so he changed ii. “And… sir… I saw about Madam Bones.”

“Yes,” said Dum­ble­dore qui­et­ly. “A ter­ri­ble loss. She was a great witch. Just up here, I think — ouch.”

He had point­ed with his in­ju­red hand.

“Pro­fes­sor, what hap­pened to your … ?”

“I have no time to ex­plain now,” said Dum­ble­dore. “It is a thrilling tale, I wish to do it jus­tice.”

He smiled at Har­ry, who un­der­stood that he was not be­ing snubbed, and that he had per­mis­sion to keep ask­ing ques­tions.

“Sir — I got a Min­istry of Mag­ic leaflet by owl, about se­cu­ri­ty mea­sures we should all take against the Death Eaters…”

“Yes, I re­ceived one my­self,” said Dum­ble­dore, still smil­ing. “Did you find it use­ful?”

“Not re­al­ly.”

“No, I thought not. You have not asked me, for in­stance, what is my fa­vorite fla­vor of jam, to check that I am in­deed Pro­fes­sor Dum­ble­dore and not an im­pos­tor.”

“I didn’t…” Har­ry be­gan, not en­tire­ly sure whether he was be­ing rep­ri­mand­ed or not.

“For fu­ture ref­er­ence, Har­ry, it is rasp­ber­ry… al­though of course, if I were a Death Eater, I would have been sure to re­search my own jam pref­er­ences be­fore im­per­son­at­ing my­self.”

“Er… right,” said Har­ry. “Well, on that leaflet, it said some­thing about In­feri. What ex­act­ly are they? The leaflet wasn’t very clear.”

“They are corpses,” said Dum­ble­dore calm­ly. “Dead bod­ies that have been be­witched to do a Dark wiz­ard’s bid­ding. In­feri have not been seen for a long time, how­ev­er, not since Volde­mort was last pow­er­ful… He killed enough peo­ple to make an army of them, of course. This is the place, Har­ry, just here…”

They were near­ing a small, neat stone house set in its own gar­den. Har­ry was too busy di­gest­ing the hor­ri­ble idea of In­feri to have much at­ten­tion left for any­thing else, but as they reached the front gate, Dum­ble­dore stopped dead and Har­ry walked in­to him.

“Oh dear. Oh dear, dear, dear.”

Har­ry fol­lowed his gaze up the care­ful­ly tend­ed front path and felt his heart sink. The front door was hang­ing off its hinges.

Dum­ble­dore glanced up and down the street. It seemed quite de­sert­ed.

“Wand out and fol­low me, Har­ry,” he said qui­et­ly.

He opened the gate and walked swift­ly and silent­ly up the gar­den path, Har­ry at his heels, then pushed the front door very slow­ly, his wand raised and at the ready.

“Lu­mos.”

Dum­ble­dore’s wand tip ig­nit­ed, cast­ing its light up a nar­row hall­way. To the left, an­oth­er door stood open. Hold­ing his il­lu­mi­nat­ed wand aloft, Dum­ble­dore walked in­to the sit­ting room with Har­ry right be­hind him.

A scene of to­tal dev­as­ta­tion met their eyes. A grand­fa­ther clock lay splin­tered at their feet, its face cracked, its pen­du­lum ly­ing a lit­tle far­ther away like a dropped sword. A pi­ano was on its side, its keys strewn across the floor. The wreck­age of a fall­en chan­de­li­er flit­tered near­by. Cush­ions lay de­flat­ed, feath­ers ooz­ing from slash­es in their sides; frag­ments of glass and chi­na lay like pow­der over ev­ery­thing. Dum­ble­dore raised his wand even high­er, so that its light was thrown up­on the walls, where some­thing dark­ly red and glu­ti­nous was spat­tered over the wall­pa­per. Har­ry’s small in­take of breath made Dum­ble­dore look around.

“Not pret­ty, is it?” he said heav­ily. “Yes, some­thing hor­ri­ble has hap­pened here.”

Dum­ble­dore moved care­ful­ly in­to the mid­dle of the room, scru­ti­niz­ing the wreck­age at his feet. Har­ry fol­lowed, gaz­ing around, half­scared of what he might see hid­den be­hind the wreck of the pi­ano or the over­turned so­fa, but there was no sign of a body.

“Maybe there was a fight and — and they dragged him off, Pro­fes­sor?” Har­ry sug­gest­ed, try­ing not to imag­ine how bad­ly wound­ed a man would have to be to leave those stains spat­tered halfway up the walls.

“I don’t think so,” said Dum­ble­dore qui­et­ly, peer­ing be­hind an over­stuffed arm­chair ly­ing on its side.

“You mean he’s — ?”

“Still here some­where? Yes.”

And with­out warn­ing, Dum­ble­dore swooped, plung­ing the tip of his wand in­to the seat of the over­stuffed arm­chair, which yelled, “Ouch!”

“Good evening, Ho­race,” said Dum­ble­dore, straight­en­ing up again.

Har­rys jaw dropped. Where a split sec­ond be­fore there had been an arm­chair, there now crouched an enor­mous­ly fat, bald, old man who was mas­sag­ing his low­er bel­ly and squint­ing up at Dum­ble­dore with an ag­grieved and wa­tery eye.

“There was no need to stick the wand in that hard,” he said gruffly, clam­ber­ing to his feet. “It hurt.”

The wan­dlight sparkled on his shiny pate, his pro­mi­nent eyes, his enor­mous, sil­ver, wal­rus­like mus­tache, and the high­ly pol­ished but­tons on the ma­roon vel­vet jack­et he was wear­ing over a pair of lilac silk pa­ja­mas. The top of his head bare­ly reached Dum­ble­dore’s chin.

“What gave it away?” he grunt­ed as he stag­gered to his feet, still rub­bing his low­er bel­ly. He seemed re­mark­ably un­abashed for a man who had just been dis­cov­ered pre­tend­ing to be an arm­chair.

“My dear Ho­race,” said Dum­ble­dore, look­ing amused, “if the Death Eaters re­al­ly had come to call, the Dark Mark would have been set over the house.”

The wiz­ard clapped a pudgy hand to his vast fore­head.

“The Dark Mark,” he mut­tered. “Knew there was some­thing… ah well. Wouldn’t have had time any­way, I’d on­ly just put the fin­ish­ing touch­es to my up­hol­stery when you en­tered the room.”

He heaved a great sigh that made the ends of his mus­tache flut­ter.

“Would you like my as­sis­tance clear­ing up?” asked Dum­ble­dore po­lite­ly.

“Please,” said the oth­er.

They stood back to back, the tall thin wiz­ard and the short round one, and waved their wands in one iden­ti­cal sweep­ing mo­tion.

The fur­ni­ture flew back to its orig­in­al places; or­na­ments relormed in midair, feath­ers zoomed in­to their cush­ions; torn books re­paired them­selves as they land­ed up­on their shelves; oil lanterns soared on­to side ta­bles and reignit­ed; avast col­lec­tion of splin­tered sil­ver pic­ture frames flew glit­ter­ing across the room and alight­ed, whole and un­tar­nished, up­on a desk; rips, cracks, and holes healed ev­ery­where, and the walls wiped them­selves clean.

“What kind of blood was that, in­ci­den­tal­ly?” asked Dum­ble­dore loud­ly over the chim­ing of the new­ly un­smashed grand­fa­ther flock.

“On the walls? Drag­on,” shout­ed the wiz­ard called Ho­race, as, with a deaf­en­ing grind­ing and tin­kling, the chan­de­li­er screwed it­self back in­to the ceil­ing.

There was a fi­nal plunk from the pi­ano, and si­lence.

“Yes, drag­on,” re­peat­ed the wiz­ard con­ver­sa­tion­al­ly. “My last bot­tle, and prices are sky­high at the mo­ment. Still, it might be reusable.”

He stumped over to a small crys­tal bot­tle stand­ing on top of a side­board and held it up to the light, ex­am­in­ing the thick liq­uid with­in.

“Hmm. Bit dusty.”

He set the bot­tle back on the side­board and sighed. It was then that his gaze fell up­on Har­ry.

“Oho,” he said, his large round eyes fly­ing to Har­ry’s fore­head and the light­ning­shaped scar it bore. “Oho!”

“This,” said Dum­ble­dore, mov­ing for­ward to make the in­tro­duc­tion, “is Har­ry Pot­ter. Har­ry, this is an old Friend and col­league of mine, Ho­race Slughorn.”

Slughorn turned on Dum­ble­dore, his ex­pres­sion shrewd. “So that’s how you thought you’d per­suade me, is it? Well, the an­swer’s no, Al­bus.”

He pushed past Har­ry, his face turned res­olute­ly away with the air of a man try­ing to re­sist temp­ta­tion.

“I sup­pose we can have a drink, at least?” asked Dum­ble­dore. “For old time’s sake?”

Slughorn hes­itat­ed.

“All right then, one drink,” he said un­gra­cious­ly.

Dum­ble­dore smiled at Har­ry and di­rect­ed him to­ward a chair not un­like the one that Slughorn had so re­cent­ly im­per­son­at­ed, which stood right be­side the new­ly burn­ing fire and a bright­ly glow­ing oil lamp. Har­ry took the seat with the dis­tinct im­pres­sion that Dum­ble­dore, for some rea­son, want­ed to keep him as vis­ible as pos­si­ble. Cer­tain­ly when Slughorn, who had been busy with de­can­ters and glass­es, turned to face the room again, his eyes fell im­me­di­ate­ly up­on Har­ry.

“Hmpf,” he said, look­ing away quick­ly as though fright­ened of hurt­ing his eyes. “Here —” He gave a drink to Dum­ble­dore, who had sat down with­out in­vi­ta­tion, thrust the tray at Har­ry, and then sank in­to the cush­ions of the re­paired so­fa and a dis­grun­tled si­lence. His legs were so short they did not touch the floor.

“Well, how have you been keep­ing, Ho­race?” Dum­ble­dore asked.

“Not so well,” said Slughorn at once. “Weak chest. Wheezy. Rheuma­tism too. Can’t move like I used to. Well, that’s to be ex­pect­ed. Old age. Fa­tigue.”

“And yet you must have moved fair­ly quick­ly to pre­pare such a wel­come for us at such short no­tice,” said Dum­ble­dore. “You can’t have had more than three min­utes’ warn­ing?”

Slughorn said, half ir­ri­ta­bly, half proud­ly, “Two. Didn’t hear my In­trud­er Charm go off, I was tak­ing a bath. Still,” he added stern­ly, seem­ing to pull him­self back to­geth­er again, “the fact re­mains that I’m an old man, Al­bus. A tired old man who’s earned the right to a qui­et life and a few crea­ture com­forts.”

He cer­tain­ly had those, thought Har­ry, look­ing around the room. It was stuffy and clut­tered, yet no­body could say it was un­com­fort­able; there were soft chairs and foot­stools, drinks and books, box­es of choco­lates and plump cush­ions. If Har­ry had not known who lived there, he would have guessed at a rich, fussy old la­dy.

“You’re not yet as old as I am, Ho­race,” said Dum­ble­dore.

“Well, maybe you ought to think about re­tire­ment your­self,” said Slughorn blunt­ly. His pale goose­ber­ry eyes had found Dum­ble­dore’s in­ju­red hand. “Re­ac­tions not what they were, I see.”

“You’re quite right,” said Dum­ble­dore serene­ly, shak­ing back his sleeve to re­veal the tips of those burned and black­ened ringers; the sight of them made the back of Har­ry’s neck prick­le un­pleas­ant­ly. “1 am un­doubt­ed­ly slow­er than I was. But on the oth­er hand…”

He shrugged and spread his hands wide, as though to say that age had its com­pen­sa­tions, and Har­ry no­ticed a ring on his un­in­ju­red hand that he had nev­er seen Dum­ble­dore wear be­fore: It was large, rather clum­si­ly made of what looked like gold, and was set with a heavy black stone that had cracked down the mid­dle. Slughorn’s eyes lin­gered for a mo­ment on the ring too, and Har­ry saw a tiny frown mo­men­tar­ily crease his wide fore­head.

“So, all these pre­cau­tions against in­trud­ers, Ho­race… are they for the Death Eaters’ ben­efit, or mine?” asked Dum­ble­dore.

“What would the Death Eaters want with a poor bro­kendown old buffer like me?” de­mand­ed Slughorn.

“I imag­ine that they would want you to turn your con­sid­er­able tal­ents to co­er­cion, tor­ture, and mur­der,” said Dum­ble­dore. “Are you re­al­ly telling me that they haven’t come re­cruit­ing yet?”

Slughorn eyed Dum­ble­dore bale­ful­ly for a mo­ment, then mut­tered, “I haven’t giv­en them the chance. I’ve been on the move for a year. Nev­er stay in one place more than a week. Move from Mug­gle house to Mug­gle house — the own­ers of this place are on hol­iday in the Ca­nary Is­lands — it’s been very pleas­ant, I’ll be sor­ry to leave. It’s quite easy once you know how, one sim­ple Freez­ing Charm on these ab­surd bur­glar alarms they use in­stead of Sneako­scopes and make sure the neigh­bors don’t spot you bring­ing in the pi­ano.”

“In­ge­nious,” said Dum­ble­dore. “But it sounds a rather tir­ing ex­is­tence for a bro­kendown old buffer in search of a qui­et life. Now, if you were to re­turn to Hog­warts —”

“If you’re go­ing to tell me my life would be more peace­ful at that pesti­len­tial school, you can save your breath, Al­bus! I might have been in hid­ing, but some fun­ny ru­mors have reached me since Do­lores Um­bridge left! If that’s how you treat teach­ers these days —”

“Pro­fes­sor Um­bridge ran afoul of our cen­taur herd,” said Dum­ble­dore. “I think you, Ho­race, would have known bet­ter than to stride in­to the for­est and call a horde of an­gry cen­taurs ‘filthy half­breeds.’”

“That’s what she did, did she?” said Slughorn. “Id­iot­ic wom­an. Nev­er liked her.”

Har­ry chuck­led and both Dum­ble­dore and Slughorn looked round at him.

“Sor­ry,” Har­ry said hasti­ly. “It’s just — I didn’t like her ei­ther.”

Dum­ble­dore stood up rather sud­den­ly.

“Are you leav­ing?” asked Slughorn at once, look­ing hope­ful.

“No, I was won­der­ing whether I might use your bath­room,” said Dum­ble­dore.

“Oh,” said Slughorn, clear­ly dis­ap­point­ed. “Sec­ond on the left down the hall.”

Dum­ble­dore strode from the room. Once the door had closed be­hind him, there was si­lence. Af­ter a few mo­ments, Slughorn got to his feet but seemed un­cer­tain what to do with him­self. He shot a furtive look at Har­ry, then crossed to the fire and turned his back on it, warm­ing his wide be­hind.

“Don’t think I don’t know why he’s brought you,” he said abrupt­ly.

Har­ry mere­ly looked at Slughorn. Slughorn’s wa­tery eyes slid over Har­ry’s scar, this time tak­ing in the rest of his face.

“You look very like your fa­ther.”

“Yeah, I’ve been told,” said Har­ry.

“Ex­cept for your eyes. You’ve got —-“

“My moth­er’s eyes, yeah.” Har­ry had heard it so of­ten he found it a bit wear­ing.

“Hmpf. Yes, well. You shouldn’t have fa­vorites as a teach­er, of course, but she was one of mine. Your moth­er,” Slughorn added, in an­swer to Har­rys ques­tion­ing look. “Lily Evans. One of the bright­est I ev­er taught. Vi­va­cious, you know. Charm­ing girl. I used to tell her she ought to have been in my House. Very cheeky an­swers I used to get back too.”

“Which was your House?”

“I was Head of Slytherin,” said Slughorn. “Oh, now,” he went on quick­ly, see­ing the ex­pres­sion on Har­ry’s face and wag­ging a stub­by ringer at him, “don’t go hold­ing that against me! You’ll be Gryffind­or like her, I sup­pose? Yes, it usu­al­ly goes in fam­ilies. Not al­ways, though. Ev­er heard of Sir­ius Black? You must have done — been in the pa­pers for the last cou­ple of years — died a few weeks ago —”

It was as though an in­vis­ible hand had twist­ed Har­ry’s in­testines and held them tight.

“Well, any­way, he was a big pal of your fa­ther’s at school. The whole Black fam­ily had been in my House, but Sir­ius end­ed up in Gryffind­or! Shame — he was a tal­ent­ed boy. I got his broth­er, Reg­ulus, when he came along, but I’d have liked the set.”

He sound­ed like an en­thu­si­as­tic col­lec­tor who had been out­bid at auc­tion. Ap­par­ent­ly lost in mem­ories, he gazed at the op­po­site wall, turn­ing idly on the spot to en­sure an even heat on his back­side.

“Your moth­er was Mug­gle­born, of course. Couldn’t be­lieve it when I found out. Thought she must have been pure­blood, she was so good.”

“One of my best friends is Mug­gle­born,” said Har­ry, “and she’s the best in our year.”

“Fun­ny how that some­times hap­pens, isn’t it?” said Slughorn.

“Not re­al­ly,” said Har­ry cold­ly.

Slughorn looked down at him in sur­prise. “You mustn’t think I’m prej­udiced!” he said. “No, no, no! Haven’t I just said your moth­er was one of my all­time fa­vorite stu­dents? And there was Dirk Cress­well in the year af­ter her too — now Head of the Gob­lin Li­ai­son Of­fice, of course — an­oth­er Mug­gle­born, a very gift­ed stu­dent, and still gives me ex­cel­lent in­side in­for­ma­tion on the go­in­gson at Gringotts!”

He bounced up and down a lit­tle, smil­ing in a self­sat­is­fied way, and point­ed at the many glit­ter­ing pho­to­graph frames on the dress­er, each peo­pled with tiny mov­ing oc­cu­pants.

“All exs­tu­dents, all signed. You’ll no­tice Barn­abas Cuffe, ed­itor of the Dai­ly Prophet, he’s al­ways in­ter­est­ed to hear my take on the day’s news. And Am­bro­sius Flume, of Hon­ey­dukes — a ham­per ev­ery birth­day, and all be­cause I was able to give him an in­tro­duc­tion to Ci­ceron Harkisss who gave him his first job! And at the back — you’ll see her if you just crane your neck — that’s Gwenog Jones, who of course cap­tains the Holy­head Harpies… Peo­ple are al­ways as­ton­ished to hear I’m on first­name terms with the Harpies, and free tick­ets when­ev­er I want them!”

This thought seemed to cheer him up enor­mous­ly.

“And all these peo­ple know where to find you, to send you stuff?” asked Har­ry, who could not help won­der­ing why the Death Eaters had not yet tracked down Slughorn if ham­pers of sweets, Quid­ditch tick­ets, and vis­itors crav­ing his ad­vice and opin­ions could find him.

The smile slid from Slughorn’s face as quick­ly as the blood from his walls.

“Of course not,” he said, look­ing down at Har­ry. “I have been out of touch with ev­ery­body for a year.”

Har­ry had the im­pres­sion that the words shocked Slughorn him­self; he looked quite un­set­tled for a mo­ment. Then he shrugged.

“Still… the pru­dent wiz­ard keeps his head down in such times. All very well for Dum­ble­dore to talk, but tak­ing up a post at Hog­warts just now would be tan­ta­mount to declar­ing my pub­lic al­le­gi­ance to the Or­der of the Phoenix! And while I’m sure they’re very ad­mirable and brave and all the rest of it, I don’t per­son­al­ly fan­cy the mor­tal­ity rate —”

“You don’t have to join the Or­der to teach at Hog­warts,” said Har­ry, who could not quite keep a note of de­ri­sion out of his voice: It was hard to sym­pa­thize with Slughorn’s cos­set­ed ex­is­tence when he re­mem­bered Sir­ius, crouch­ing in a cave and liv­ing on rats. “Most of the teach­ers aren’t in it, and none of them has ev­er been killed — well, un­less you count Quir­rell, and he got what he de­served see­ing as he was work­ing with Volde­mort.”

Har­ry had been sure Slughorn would be one of those wiz­ards who could not bear to hear Volde­mort’s name spo­ken aloud, and was not dis­ap­point­ed: Slughorn gave a shud­der and a squawk of protest, which Har­ry ig­nored.

“I reck­on the staff are safer than most peo­ple while Dum­ble­dore’s head­mas­ter; he’s sup­posed to be the on­ly one Volde­mort ev­er feared, isn’t he?” Har­ry went on.

Slughorn gazed in­to space for a mo­ment or two: He seemed to be think­ing over Har­ry’s words.

“Well, yes, it is true that He­Who­Must­Not­Be­Named has nev­er sought a fight with Dum­ble­dore,” he mut­tered grudg­ing­ly. “And I sup­pose one could ar­gue that as I have not joined the Death Kil­ters, He­Who­Must­Not­Be­Named can hard­ly count me a friend… in which case, I might well be safer a lit­tle clos­er to Al­bus… I can­not pre­tend that Amelia Bones’s death did not shake me… If she, with all her Min­istry con­tacts and pro­tec­tion…”

Dum­ble­dore reen­tered the room and Slughorn jumped as though he had for­got­ten he was in the house.

“Oh, there you are, Al­bus,” he said. “You’ve been a very long lime. Up­set stom­ach?”

“No, I was mere­ly read­ing the Mug­gle mag­azines,” said Dum­ble­dore. “I do love knit­ting pat­terns. Well, Har­ry, we have tres­passed up­on Ho­race’s hos­pi­tal­ity quite long enough; I think it is time for us to leave.”

Not at all re­luc­tant to obey, Har­ry jumped to his feet. Slughorn sinned tak­en aback.

“You’re leav­ing?”

“Yes, in­deed. I think I know a lost cause when I see one.”

“Lost…?”

Slughorn seemed ag­itat­ed. He twid­dled his fat thumbs and fid­get­ed as he watched Dum­ble­dore fas­ten his trav­el­ing cloak, and Har­ry zip up his jack­et.

“Well, I’m sor­ry you don’t want the job, Ho­race,” said Dum­ble­dore, rais­ing his un­in­ju­red hand in a farewell salute. “Hog­warts would have been glad to see you back again. Our great­ly in­creased se­cu­ri­ty notwith­stand­ing, you will al­ways be wel­come to vis­it, should you wish to.”

“Yes… well… very gra­cious… as I say…”

“Good­bye, then.”

“Bye,” said Har­ry.

They were at the front door when there was a shout from be­hind them.

“All right, all right, I’ll do it!”

Dum­ble­dore turned to see Slughorn stand­ing breath­less in the door­way to the sit­ting room.

“You will come out of re­tire­ment?”

“Yes, yes,” said Slughorn im­pa­tient­ly. “I must be mad, but yes.”

“Won­der­ful,” said Dum­ble­dore, beam­ing. “Then, Ho­race, we shall see you on the first of Septem­ber.”

“Yes, I dare­say you will,” grunt­ed Slughorn.

As they set off down the gar­den path, Slughorn’s voice float­ed af­ter them, “I’ll want a pay rise, Dum­ble­dore!”

Dum­ble­dore chuck­led. The gar­den gate swung shut be­hind them, and they set off back down the hill through the dark and the swirling mist.

“Well done, Har­ry,” said Dum­ble­dore.

“I didn’t do any­thing,” said Har­ry in sur­prise.

“Oh yes you did. You showed Ho­race ex­act­ly how much he stands to gain by re­turn­ing to Hog­warts. Did you like him?”

“Er…”

Har­ry wasn’t sure whether he liked Slughorn or not. He sup­posed he had been pleas­ant in his way, but he had al­so seemed vain and, what­ev­er he said to the con­trary, much too sur­prised that a Mug­gle­born should make a good witch.

“Ho­race,” said Dum­ble­dore, re­liev­ing Har­ry of the re­spon­si­bil­ity to say any of this, “likes his com­fort. He al­so likes the com­pa­ny of the fa­mous, the suc­cess­ful, and the pow­er­ful. He en­joys the feel­ing that he in­flu­ences these peo­ple. He has nev­er want­ed to oc­cu­py the throne him­self; he prefers the back­seat — more room to spread out, you see. He used to hand­pick fa­vorites at Hog­warts, some­times for their am­bi­tion or their brains, some­times for their charm or their tal­ent, and he had an un­can­ny knack for choos­ing those who would go on to be­come out­stand­ing in their var­ious fields. Ho­race formed a kind of club of his fa­vorites with him­self at the cen­ter, mak­ing in­tro­duc­tions, forg­ing use­ful con­tacts be­tween mem­bers, and al­ways reap­ing some kind of ben­efit in re­turn, whether a free box of his fa­vorite crys­tal­lized pineap­ple or the chance to rec­om­mend the next ju­nior mem­ber of the Gob­lin li­ai­son Of­fice.”

Har­ry had a sud­den and vivid men­tal im­age of a great swollen spi­der, spin­ning a web around it, twitch­ing a thread here and there to bring its large and juicy flies a lit­tle clos­er.

“I tell you all this,” Dum­ble­dore con­tin­ued, “not to turn you against Ho­race — or, as we must now call him, Pro­fes­sor Slughorn — but to put you on your guard. He will un­doubt­ed­ly try to col­lect you, Har­ry. You would be the jew­el of his col­lec­tion; ‘the Boy Who Lived’… or, as they call you these days, ‘the Cho­sen One.’”

At these words, a chill that had noth­ing to do with the sur­round­ing mist stole over Har­ry. He was re­mind­ed of words he had heard a few weeks ago, words that had a hor­ri­ble and par­tic­ular mean­ing to him: Nei­ther can live while the oth­er sur­vives…

Dum­ble­dore had stopped walk­ing, lev­el with the church they had passed ear­li­er.

“This will do, Har­ry. If you will grasp my arm.”

Braced this time, Har­ry was ready for the Ap­pari­tion, but still found it un­pleas­ant. When the pres­sure dis­ap­peared and he found him­self able to breathe again, he was stand­ing in a coun­try lane be­side Dum­ble­dore and look­ing ahead to the crooked sil­hou­ette of his sec­ond fa­vorite build­ing in the world: the Bur­row. In spite of the feel­ing of dread that had just swept through him, his spir­its could not help but lift at the sight of it. Ron was in there… and so was Mrs. Weasley, who could cook bet­ter than any­one he knew…

“If you don’t mind, Har­ry,” said Dum­ble­dore, as they passed through the gate, “I’d like a few words with you be­fore we part. In pri­vate. Per­haps in here?”

Dum­ble­dore point­ed to­ward a run­down stone out­house where the Weasleys kept their broom­sticks. A lit­tle puz­zled, Har­ry fol­lowed Dum­ble­dore through the creak­ing door in­to a space a lit­tle small­er than the av­er­age cup­board. Dum­ble­dore il­lu­mi­nat­ed the tip of his wand, so that it glowed like a torch, and smiled down at Har­ry.

“I hope you will for­give me for men­tion­ing it, Har­ry, but I am pleased and a lit­tle proud at how well you seem to be cop­ing af­ter ev­ery­thing that hap­pened at the Min­istry. Per­mit me to say that I think Sir­ius would have been proud of you.”

Har­ry sw­al­lowed; his voice seemed to have de­sert­ed him. He did not think he could stand to dis­cuss Sir­ius; it had been painful enough to hear Un­cle Ver­non say “His god­fa­ther’s dead?” and even worse to hear Sir­iuss name thrown out ca­su­al­ly by Slughorn.

“It was cru­el,” said Dum­ble­dore soft­ly, “that you and Sir­ius had such a short time to­geth­er. A bru­tal end­ing to what should have been a long and hap­py re­la­tion­ship.”

Har­ry nod­ded, his eyes fixed res­olute­ly on the spi­der now climb­ing Dum­ble­dore’s hat. He could tell that Dum­ble­dore un­der­stood, that he might even sus­pect that un­til his let­ter ar­rived, Har­ry had spent near­ly all his time at the Durs­leys’ ly­ing on his bed, re­fus­ing meals, and star­ing at the mist­ed win­dow, full of the chill emp­ti­ness i hat he had come to as­so­ciate with de­men­tors.

“It’s just hard,” Har­ry said fi­nal­ly, in a low voice, “to re­al­ize he won’t write to me again.”

His eyes burned sud­den­ly and he blinked. He felt stupid for ad­mit­ting it, but the fact that he had had some­one out­side Hog­warts who cared what hap­pened to him, al­most like a par­ent, had been one of the best things about dis­cov­er­ing his god­fa­ther… and now the post owls would nev­er bring him that com­fort again…

“Sir­ius rep­re­sent­ed much to you that you had nev­er known be­fore,” said Dum­ble­dore gen­tly. “Nat­ural­ly, the loss is dev­as­tat­ing…

“But while I was at the Durs­leys’…” in­ter­rupt­ed Har­ry, his voice grow­ing stronger, “I re­al­ized I cant shut my­self away or — or crack up. Sir­ius wouldn’t have want­ed that, would he? And any­way, life’s too short… Look at Madam Bones, look at Em­me­line Vance… It could be me next, couldn’t it? But if it is,” he said fierce­ly, now look­ing straight in­to Dum­ble­dore’s blue eyes gleam­ing in the wan­dlight, “I’ll make sure I take as many Death Eaters with me as I can, and Volde­mort too if I can man­age it.”

“Spo­ken both like your moth­er and fa­ther’s son and Sir­ius’s true god­son!” said Dum­ble­dore, with an ap­prov­ing pat on Har­ry’s back. “I take my hat off to you — or I would, if I were not afraid of show­er­ing you in spi­ders.

“And now, Har­ry, on a close­ly re­lat­ed sub­ject… I gath­er that you have been tak­ing the Dai­ly Prophet over the last two weeks?”

“Yes,” said Har­ry, and his heart beat a lit­tle faster.

“Then you will have seen that there have been not so much leaks as floods con­cern­ing your ad­ven­ture in the Hall of Prophe­cy?”

“Yes,” said Har­ry again. “And now ev­ery­one knows that I’m the one —

“No, they do not,” in­ter­rupt­ed Dum­ble­dore. “There are on­ly two peo­ple in the whole world who know the full con­tents of the prophe­cy made about you and Lord Volde­mort, and they are both stand­ing in this smelly, spi­dery broom shed. It is true, how­ev­er, that many have guessed, cor­rect­ly, that Volde­mort sent his Death Eaters to steal a prophe­cy, and that the prophe­cy con­cerned you.

“Now, I think I am cor­rect in say­ing that you have not told any­body that you know what the prophe­cy said?”

“No,” said Har­ry.

“A wise de­ci­sion, on the whole,” said Dum­ble­dore. “Al­though I think you ought to re­lax it in fa­vor of your friends, Mr. Ronald Weasley and Miss Hermione Granger. Yes,” he con­tin­ued, when Har­ry looked star­tled, “I think they ought to know. You do them a dis­ser­vice by not con­fid­ing some­thing this im­por­tant to them.”

“I didn’t want —”

“— to wor­ry or fright­en them?” said Dum­ble­dore, sur­vey­ing Har­ry over the top of his half­moon spec­ta­cles. “Or per­haps, to con­fess that you your­self are wor­ried and fright­ened? You need your friends, Har­ry. As you so right­ly said, Sir­ius would not have want­ed you to shut your­self away.”

Har­ry said noth­ing, but Dum­ble­dore did not seem to re­quire an an­swer. He con­tin­ued, “On a dif­fer­ent, though re­lat­ed, sub­ject, it is my wish that you take pri­vate lessons with me this year.”

“Pri­vate — with you?” said Har­ry, sur­prised out of his pre­oc­cu­pied si­lence.

“Yes. I think it is time that I took a greater hand in your ed­uca­tion.”

What will you be teach­ing me, sir?”

“Oh, a lit­tle of this, a lit­tle of that,” said Dum­ble­dore air­ily.

Har­ry wait­ed hope­ful­ly, but Dum­ble­dore did not elab­orate, so ho asked some­thing else that had been both­er­ing him slight­ly.

“If I’m hav­ing lessons with you, I won’t have to do Oc­clu­men­cy lessons with Snape, will I?”

”Pro­fes­sor Snape, Har­ry — and no, you will not.”

“Good,” said Har­ry in re­lief, “be­cause they were a —”

He stopped, care­ful not to say what he re­al­ly thought.

“I think the word ‘fi­as­co’ would be a good one here,” said Dum­ble­dore, nod­ding.

Har­ry laughed.

“Well, that means I won’t see much of Pro­fes­sor Snape from now on,” he said, “be­cause he won’t let me car­ry on Po­tions un­less I get ‘Out­stand­ing’ in my OWL., which I know I haven’t.”

“Don’t count your owls be­fore they are de­liv­ered,” said Dum­ble­dore grave­ly. “Which, now I think of it, ought to be some time lat­er to­day. Now, two more things, Har­ry, be­fore we part.

“First­ly, I wish you to keep your In­vis­ibil­ity Cloak with you at all i imes from this mo­ment on­ward. Even with­in Hog­warts it­self. Just in case, you un­der­stand me?”

Har­ry nod­ded.

“And last­ly, while you stay here, the Bur­row has been giv­en the high­est se­cu­ri­ty the Min­istry of Mag­ic can pro­vide. These mea­sures have caused a cer­tain amount of in­con­ve­nience to Arthur and Mol­ly — all their post, for in­stance, is be­ing searched at the Min­istry be­fore be­ing sent on. They do not mind in the slight­est, for their on­ly con­cern is your safe­ty. How­ev­er, it would be poor re­pay­ment if you risked your neck while stay­ing with them.”

“I un­der­stand,” said Har­ry quick­ly.

“Very well, then,” said Dum­ble­dore, push­ing open the broom shed door and step­ping out in­to the yard. “I see a light in the kitchen. Let us not de­prive Mol­ly any longer of the chance to de­plore how thin you are.”
