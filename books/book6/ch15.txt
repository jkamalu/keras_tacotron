Chapter 15: The Unbreakable Vow


Snow was swirling against the icy win­dows once more; Christ­mas was ap­proach­ing fast. Ha­grid had al­ready sin­gle­hand­ed­ly de­liv­ered the usu­al twelve C hrist­mas trees to the Great Hall; gar­lands of hol­ly and tin­sel had been twist­ed around the ban­is­ters of the stairs; ev­er­last­ing can­dles glowed from in­side the hel­mets of suits of ar­mor and great bunch­es of mis­tle­toe had been hung at in­ter­vals along the cor­ri­dors. Large groups of girls tend­ed to con­verge un­der­neath the mis­tle­toe bunch­es ev­ery time Har­ry went past, which caused block­ages in the cor­ri­dors; for­tu­nat e ly, how­ev­er, Har­ry’s fre­quent night­time wan­der­in­gs had giv­en him an un­usu­al­ly good knowl­edge of the cas­tle’s se­cret pas­sage­ways, so that he was of­ten, with­out too much dif­fi­cul­ty, to nav­iga t e mis­tle­toe­free routes be­tween class­es.

Ron, who might once have found the ne­ces­si­ty of these de­tours ex­cuse for jeal­ousy rather than hi­lar­ity, sim­ply roared with laugh­ter about it all. Al­though Har­ry much pre­ferred this new laugh­ing, jok­ing Ron to the moody, ag­gres­sive mod­el he had been en­dur­ing for the last few weeks, the im­proved Ron came at a heavy price. First­ly, Har­ry had to put up with the fre­quent pres­ence of Laven­der Brown, who seemed to re­gard any mo­ment that she was not kiss­ing Ron as a mo­ment wast­ed; and sec­ond­ly, Har­ry found him­self once more the best friend of two peo­ple who seemed un­like­ly ev­er to speak to each oth­er again.

Ron, whose hands and fore­arms still bore scratch­es and cuts from Hermione’s bird at­tack, was tak­ing a de­fen­sive and re­sent­ful tone.

“She can’t com­plain,” he told Har­ry. “She snogged Krum. So she’s found out some­one wants to snog me too. Well, it’s a free coun­try. I haven’t done any­thing wrong.”

Har­ry did not an­swer, but pre­tend­ed to be ab­sorbed in the book they were sup­posed to have read be­fore Charms next morn­ing (Quintessence: A Q uest). De­ter­mined as he was to re­main friends with both Ron and Hermione, he was spend­ing a lot of time with his mouth shut tight.

“I nev­er promised Hermione any­thing , ” Ron mum­bled. “I mean, all right, I was go­ing to go to Slughorn’s Christ­mas par­ty with her, but she nev­er said… just as friends… I’m a free agent…”

Har­ry turned a page of Quintessence, aware that Ron was watch­ing him. Ron’s voice trailed away in mut­ters, bare­ly au­di­ble over the loud crack­ling of the fire, though Har­ry thought he caught the words “Krum” and “Can’t com­plain” again.

Hermione’s sched­ule was so full that Har­ry could on­ly talk to her prop­er­ly in the evenings, when Ron was, in any case, so tight­ly wrapped around Laven­der that he did not no­tice what Har­ry was do­ing. Hermione re­fused to sit in the com­mon room while Ron was there, So Har­ry gen­er­al­ly joined her in the li­brary, which meant that their con­ver­sa­tions were held in whis­pers.

“He’s at per­fect lib­er­ty to kiss whomev­er he likes,” said Hermione, while the li­brar­ian , Madam Pince, prowled the shelves be­hind them. “I re­al­ly couldn’t care less.”

She raised her quill and dot­ted an ‘i’ so fe­ro­cious­ly that she punc­tured a hole in her parch­ment. Har­ry said noth­ing. He thought his voice might soon van­ish from the lack of use. He bent a lit­tle low­er over Ad­vanced Po­tion­Mak­ing and con­tin­ued to make notes on Ev­er­last­ing Elixirs, oc­ca­sion­al­ly paus­ing to de­ci­pher the p rince’s use­ful ad­di­tions to Li­batius B or­age’s text.

“And in­ci­den­tal­ly,” said Hermione, af­ter a few mo­ments, “you need to be care­ful.”

“For the last time,” said Har­ry, speak­ing in a slight­ly hoarse tone af­ter three­quar­ters of an ho u r of si­lence, “I am not giv­ing back this book . I’ve learned more from the Half­blood p rince than Snape or Slughorn have taught me in–“

“I’m not talk­ing about your stupid so­called prince,” said Hermione , giv­ing his book a nasty look as though it had been rude to her. “I’m tal­ki ng about ear­li­er. I went in­to the girl’s bath­room just be­fore I came in here and there were about a dozen girls in there, in­clud­ing that Romil­da Vane , try­ing to de­cide how to slip you a love po­tion. They’re all hop­ing they’re go­ing to get you to take them to Slughorn’s par­ty, and thay all seem to have bought Fred and George’s love po­tions, which I’m afraid to say prob­ably work –“

“Why didn’t you con­fis­cate them then?” de­mand­ed Har­ry, it seemed ex­traor­di­nary that Hermione’s m ania for up­hold­ing the rules could have aban­doned her at this cru­cial junc­ture.

“They didn’t have the po­tions with them in the bath­room,” said Hermione scorn­ful­ly, “They were just dis­cussing tac­tics. As I doubt the Half­blood prince” she gave the book an­oth­er scorn­ful look “could dream up an an­ti­dote for a dozen dif­fer­ent love po­tions at once, I’d just in­vite some­one to go with you, that’ll stop all the oth­ers think­ing they’ve still got a chance. It’s to­mor r ow night, they’re get­ting des­per­ate.”

“There isn’t any­one I want to in­vite,” mum­bled Har­ry, who was still not try­ing to think about Gin­ny any more than he could help, de­spite the fact the fact that she kept crop­ping up in his dreams in ways that made him de­vout­ly thank­ful that Ron could not per­form Legili­men­cy.

“Well, just be care­ful what you drink, be­cause Romil­da Va ne looked like she meant busi­ness.” said Hermione grim­ly.

She hitched up the long roll of parch­ment on which she was writ­ing her Arith­ma n cy es­say and con­tin­ued to scratch away with her quill. Har­ry wa t che d her with his mind a long way away.

“Hang on a mo­ment,” he said slow­ly. “I thought Filch had banned any­thing bought at Weasley’s Wiz­ard Wheezes?”

“And when has any­one ev­er paid at­ten­tion to what Filch has banned?” asked Hermione, still con­cen­trat­ing on her es­say.

“But I thought all the owls were be­ing searched. So how come these grils are able to bring love po­tions in­to the school?”

“Fred and George send them dis­guised as per­fumes and cough po­tions,” said Hermione. “It’s part of their Owl or­der ser­vice.”

“You know a lot about it.”

Hermione gave him the kind of nasty look she had just giv­en his copy of Ad­vanced Po­tion­Mak­ing.

“It was all on the back of the bot­tles they showed Gin­ny and me in the sum­mer,” she said cold­ly, “I don’t go around putting po­tions in peo­ple’s drinks… or pre­tend­ing too eit h er, which is just as bad…”

“Yeah, well, nev­er mind that,” said Har­ry quick­ly. “The point is, Filch is be­ing fooled isn’t he? These girls are get­ting stuff in­to the school dis­guised as some­thing else! So why couldn’t Mal­foy have brought the neck­lace in­to the school –?”

“Oh, Har­ry… not that again…”

“Come on, why not?” de­mand­ed Har­ry.

“Look , ” sighed Hermione, “Se­cre­cy Sen­sors de­tect jinx­es, curs­es, and con­ceal­ment charms, don’t they? They’re used to find d ark mag­ic and d ark ob­je c ts. They’d have picked up a pow­er­ful curse , like the one in the neck­lace, withi n sec­onds. But some­thing that’s just been put in the wrong bot­tle wouldn ‘ t reg­is­ter — any­way Love po­tions aren’t d ark or dan­ger­ous -“

“Easy for you to say,” mut­tered Har­ry, think­ing of Romil­da Vane.

“– so it would be down to Filch to re­alise it wasn’t a cough po­tion, and he’s not a very good wiz­ard, I doubt he can tell one po­tion from –“

Hermione stopped dead; Har­ry had heard it too. Some­body had moved close be­hind them among the dark book­shelves. They wait­ed, and a mo­ment lat­er the vul­ture­like coun­te­nance of Madam Pince ap­peared around the cor­ner, her sunken cheeks, her skin like parch­ment, and her long hooked nose il­lu­mi­nat­ed un­flat­ter­ing­ly by the lamp she was car­ry­ing.

“The li­brary is now closed,” she said, “Mind you re­turn any­thing you have bor­rowed to the cor­rect — what have you been do­ing to that book, you de­praved boy?”

“It isn’t the li­brary’s, it’s mine!” said Har­ry hasti­ly, snatch­ing his copy of Ad­vanced Po­tion­Mak­ing off the ta­ble as she lunged at it with a claw­like hand.

” Spoiled!” she hissed . “Des­ecrat­ed, be­fouled !”

“It’s just a book that’s been writ­ten on!” said Har­ry, tug­ging it out of her grip.

She looked as though she might have a seizure; Hermione, who had hasti­ly packed her things, grabbed Har­ry by the arm and frog­marched him away.

“She’ll ban you from the li­brary if you’re not care­ful. Why did you have to bring that stupid book?”

“It’s not my fault she’s bark­ing mad, Hermione. Or d’you think she over­heard you be­ing rude about Filch? I’ve al­ways thought there might be some­thing be­tween them…”

“Oh, ha ha..”

En­joy­ing the fact that they could speak nor­mal­ly again, they made their way along the de­sert­ed lam­plit cor­ri­dors back to the com­mon room, ar­gu­ing w het­her or not Filch and Madam Pince were se­cret­ly in love with each oth­er.

“Baubles” said Har­ry to the Fat La­dy, this be­ing the new, fes­tive pass­word.

“Same to you,” said the fat la­dy with a rogu­ish grin, and she swung for­ward to ad­mit them.

“Hi, Har­ry!” said Romil­da Vane, the mo­ment he had climbed through the por­trait hole. “Fan­cy a gilly­wa­ter?”

Hermione gave him a “what­didItel­ly­ou?” look over her shoul­der.

“No thanks,” said Har­ry quick­ly. “I don’t like it much.”

“Well, take these any­way,” said Romil­da, thrust­ing a box in­to his hands. “Choco­late Caul­drons, they’ve got firewhiskey in them. My gran sent them to me, but I don’t like them.”

“Oh– right — thanks a lot.” said Har­ry, who could not think what else to say. ” Er– I ‘ m just go­ing over here with …”

He hur­ried off be­hind Hermione, his voice tail­ing away fee­bly.

“Told you,” said Hermione suc­cinct­ly, ” Soon­er you ask some­one, soon­er they’ll all leave you alone and you can –“

But her face sud­dnly turned blank; she had just spot­ted Ron and Laven­der, who were i nter­twined in the same arm­chair.

“Well, good night, Har­ry” said Hermione, though it was on­ly sev­en o’clock in the evening, and she left for the girl s’ dor­mi­to­ry with­out an­oth­er word.

Har­ry went to bed com­fort­ing him­self that there was on­ly one more day of lessons to strug­gle through, plus Slughorn’s par­ty, af­ter which he and Ron would de­part to­geth­er for the B ur­row. It now seemed im­pos­si­ble that Ron and Hermione would make up with each oth­er be­fore the hol­idays be­gan, but per­haps, some­how, the break would give them time to calm down, think bet­ter of their be­hav­ior…

But his hopes were not high, and they sank still low­er af­ter en­dur­ing a Trans­fig­ura­tion les­son with them both next day. They had just em­barked up­on the im­mense­ly dif­fi­cult top­ic of hu­man trans­fig­ura­tion; work­ing in front of mir­rors , they were su­posed to be chang­ing the col­or of their own eye­brows. Hermione laughed un­kind­ly at Ron’s dis­as­trous first at­tempt, dur­ing which he some­how man­aged to give him­self a spec­tac­ular han­dle­bar mus­tache; Ron re­tal­iat­ed by do­ing a cru­el but ac­cu­rate im­pres­sion of Hermione jump­ing up and down in her seat ev­ery time Profe s sor McG­ona­gall asked a ques­tion, which Laven­der and Par­vati found deeply amus­ing and which re­duced Hermione to the verge of tears again. She raced out of the class­room on the bell, leav­ing half her things be­hind; Har­ry, de­cid­ing that her need was greater than Ron’s just now, scooped up her re­main­ing po ss­es­sions and fol­lowed her.

He fi­nal­ly tracked her down as she emerged from a girl’s bath­room on the floor be­low. She was ac­com­pa­nied by Lu­na Love­good, who was pat­ting her vague­ly on the back.

“Oh, hel­lo, Har­ry , ” said Lu­na . ” D id you know one of your eye­brows is bright yel­low?”

“Hi, Lu­na. Hermione , you left your stuff…”

He held out her books.

“Oh, yes,” said Hermione in a choked voice, tak­ing her things and turn­ing away quick­ly to hide the fact she was wip­ing her eyes with her pen­cil case. “Thank you , Har­ry. Well, I’d bet­ter get go­ing…”

And she hur­ried off, with­out ev­er giv­ing Har­ry any time to of­fer words of com­fort, though ad­mit­ted­ly he could not think of any.

“She’s a bit up­set , ” said Lu­na. “I thought at first it was Moan­ing Myr­tle in there, but it turned out to be Hermione. She said some­thing about Ron Weasley…”

“Yeah, they’ve had a row,” said Har­ry.

“He says fun­ny things some­times, doesn’t he?” said Lu­na as they set off down the cor­ri­dor to­geth­er. “But he can be a bit un­kind. I no­ticed that last year.”

” I s’pose , ” said Har­ry. Lu­na was de­mon­strat­ing her usu­al knack of speak­ing un­com­fort­able truths; he had nev­er met any­one quite like her. “So have you had a good term?”

“Oh, it’s been al l right,” said Lu­na. ” A bit lone­ly with­out the D.A. Gin­ny’s been nice, though. She stopped two boys in our Trans­fig­ura­tion class call­ing me ‘Loony’ the oth­er day –“

“How would you like to come to S lughorn’s par­ty with me tonight?”

The words were out of Har­ry’s mouth be­fore he could stop them; he heard him­self say them as though it were a stranger speak­ing.

Lu­na turned her pro­tu­ber­ant eyes to him in sur­prise.

“Slughorn’s par­ty? With you?”

“Yeah,” said Har­ry, “We’re sup­posed to bring guests, so I thought you might like.. I mean…” He was keen to make his in­ten­tions per­fect­ly clear. ” I mean, just as friends, you know. But if you don’t want to…”

He was al­ready half hop­ing that she didn’t want to.

“O h no, I’d love to go with you as friends!” said Lu­na, beam­ing as he had nev­er seen her beam be­fore. “No­body’s ev­er asked me to a par­ty be­fore, as a friend! Is that why you dyed your eye­brow, for the par­ty? Should I dye mine too?”

“No” said Har­ry firm­ly, “That was a mis­take. I’ll get Hermione to put it right for me. So I’ll meet you in the en­trance hall at eight o’clock then . “

“AHA!” screamed a voice from over­head and both of them jumped; un­no­ticed by ei­ther of them, they had just passed un­der­neath Peeves, who was hang­ing up­side down from a chan­de­li­er and grin­ning ma­li­cious­ly at them.

“Pot­ty asked Loony to go to the part y ! Pot­ty lurves Loony! Pot­ty lu­uu­uu­urves Looooony!”

And he zoomed away cack­ling and shriek­ing, “Pot­ty loves Loony!”

“Nice to keep these things pri­vate,” said Har­ry. And sure enough, in no time at all the whole school seemed to know that Har­ry Pot­ter was tak­ing Lu­na Love­good to Slughorn’s par­ty.

“You could’ve tak­en any­one!” said Ron in dis­be­lief over din­ner. “Any­one! And you chose Loony Love­good?”

“Don’t call her that, Ron!” snapped Gin­ny, paus­ing be­hind Har­ry on her way to join friends. “I’m re­al­ly glad you’re tak­ing her Har­ry, she’s so ex­cit­ed.”

And she moved on down the ta­ble to sit with Dean. Har­ry tried to feel pleased that Gin­ny was glad he was tak­ing Lu­na to the par­ty but could not quite man­age it. A long way along the ta­ble Hermione was sit­ting alone, play­ing with her stew. Har­ry no­ticed Ron look­ing at her furtive­ly.

“You could say sor­ry , ” sug­gest­ed Har­ry blunt­ly.

“What , and get at­tacked by an­oth­er flock of ca­nar­ies?” mut­tered Ron.

“What did you have to im­itate her for?”

“She laughed at my mus­tache!”

“So did I, it was the stupi­dest thing I’ve ev­er seen.”

But Ron did not seem to have he a rd; Laven­der had just ar­rived with Par­vati. Squeez­ing her­self in be­tween Har­ry and Ron, Laven­der flung her arms around Ron’s neck.

“Hi, Har­ry,” said Par­vati who, like Har­ry, looked faint­ly em­bar­rassed and bored by the be­hav­ior of their two friends.

“Hi,” said Har­ry, “How’re you? You’re stay­ing at Hog­warts, then? I heard your par­ents want­ed you to leave.”

“I man­aged to talk them out o f it for the time be­ing,” said Par­vati. “That Katie thing re­al­ly freaked them out, but as there hasn’t been any­thing since… Oh, hi, Hermione!”

Par­vati pos­itive­ly beamed. Har­ry could tell that she was feel­ing guilty for hav­ing laughed at Hermione in Trans­fig­ura­tion. He looked around and saw that Hermione was beam­ing back, if pos­si­ble even more bright­ly. Girls were very strange some­times.

“Hi, Par­vati!” said Hermione, ig­nor­ing Ron and Laven­der com­plete­ly. “Are you go­ing to Slughorn’s par­ty tonight?”

“No in­vite,” said Par­vati gloo­mi­ly. “I’d love to go, though, it sounds like it’s go­ing to be re­al­ly good… You’re go­ing, aren’t you?”

“Yes, I’m meet­ing Cor­mac at eight, and we’re -“

There was a noise like a plunger be­ing with­drawn from a blocked sink , and Ron sur­faced. Hermione act­ed as though she had not seen or heard any­thing.

“- we’re go­ing up to the par­ty to­geth­er.”

“Cor­mac?” said Par­vati. “Cor­mac McLaggen, you mean?”

“That’s right,” said Hermione sweet­ly. “The one who *al­most*” - she put a great deal of em­pha­sis on the word - “bec a me Gryffind­or Keep­er.”

“Are you go­ing out with him, then?” asked Par­vati, wideeyed.

“Oh - yes - didn’t you know?” said Harmione, with a most un­Hermioneish gig­gle.

“No!” said Par­vati, look­ing pos­itive­ly agog at thi s piece of gos­sip. “Wow , you like your Quid­ditch play­ers, don’t you? First Krum, then McLaggen.”

“I like *re­al­ly good* Quid­ditch play­ers,” Hermione cor­rect­ed her, still smil­ing. “Well, see you… Got to go and get ready for the par­ty…”

She left. At once Laven­der and Par­vati put their heads to­geth­er to dis­cuss this new de­vel­op­ment, with ev­ery­thing they had ev­er heard about McLaggen, and all they had ev­er guessed about Hermione. Ron looked strange­ly blank and said noth­ing. Har­ry was left to pon­der in si­lence the depths to which girls would sink to get re­venge.

When he ar­rived in the en­trance hall at eight o’clock that night, he found an un­usu­al­ly large num­ber of girls lurk­ing there, all of whom seemed to be star­ing at him re­sent­ful­ly as he ap­proached Lu­na. She was wear­ing a set of span­gled sil­ver robes that were at­tract­ing a cer­tain amount of gig­gles from the on­look­ers, but oth­er­wise she looked quite nice. Har­ry was glad, in any case, that she had left off her radish ear­rings, her but­ter­beer cork neck­lace, and her Spec­tre­specs.

“Hi,” he said. “Shall we get go­ing then?”

“Oh yes,” she said hap­pi­ly. “Where is the par­ty?”

“Slughorn’s of­fice,” said Har­ry, lead­ing her up the mar­ble stair­case away from all the star­ing and mut­ter­ing. “Did you hear, there’s sup­posed to be a vam­pire com­ing?”

“Ru­fus Scrim­geour?” asked Lu­na.

“I - what?” said Har­ry, dis­con­cert­ed. “You mean the Min­is­ter of Mag­ic?”

“Yes, he’s a vam­pire,” said Lu­na mat­terof­fact­ly. “Fa­ther wrote a very long ar­ti­cle about it when Scrim­geour first took over from Cor­nelius Fudge, but he was forced not to pub­lish by some­body from the Min­istry. Ob­vi­ous­ly, they didn’t want the truth to get out!”

Har­ry, who thought it most un­like­ly that Ru­fus Scrim­geour was a vam­pire, but who was used to Lu­na re­peat­ing her fa­ther’s bizarre views as though they were fact, did not re­ply; they were al­ready ap­proach­ing Slughorn’s of­fice and the sounds of laugh­ter, mu­sic, and loud con­ver­sa­tion were grow­ing loud­er with ev­ery step they took.

Whether it had been built that way, or be­cause he had used mag­ical trick­ery to make it so, Slughorn’s of­fice was much larg­er than the usu­al teach­er’s study. The ceil­ing and walls had been draped with emer­ald, crim­son , and gold hang­in­gs, so that it looked as though they were all in­side a vast tent. The room was crowd­ed and stuffy and bathed in the red light cast by an or­nate gold­en lamp dan­gling from the cen­ter of the ceil­ing in which re­al fairies were flut­ter­ing, each a bril­liant speck of light. Loud singing ac­com­pa­nied by what sound­ed like man­dolins is­sued from a dis­tant cor­ner; a haze of pipe smoke hung over sev­er­al el­der­ly war­locks deep in con­ver­sa­tion, and a num­ber of house­elves were ne­go­ti­at­ing their way squeak­ily through the for­est of knees, ob­scured by the heavy sil­ver plat­ters of food they were bear­ing, so that they looked like lit­tle rov­ing ta­bles.

“Har­ry, m’boy!” boomed Slughorn, al­most as soon as Har­ry and Lu­na had squeezed in through the door. “Come in, come in, so many peo­ple I’d like you to meet!”

Slughorn was wear­ing a tas­seled vel­vet hat to match his smok­ing jack­et. Grip­ping Har­ry’s arm so tight­ly he might have been hop­ing to Dis­ap­pa­rate with him, Slughorn led him pur­pose­ful­ly in­to the par­ty; Har­ry seized Lu­na’s hand and dragged her along with him.

“Har­ry, I’d like you to meet El­dred Wor­ple, an old stu­dent of mine, au­thor of ‘ Blood Broth­ers: My L ife Amongst the Vam­pires’ - and, of course, his friend San­gui­ni.”

Wor­ple, who was a small, stout, be­spec­ta­cled man, grabbed Har­ry’s hand and shook it en­thu­si­as­ti­cal­ly; the vam­pire San­gui­ni, who was tall and ema­ci­at­ed with dark shad­ows un­der his eyes, mere­ly nod­ded. He looked rather bored. A gag­gle of girls was stand­ing close to him, look­ing cu­ri­ous and ex­cit­ed.

“Har­ry Pot­ter, I am sim­ply de­light­ed!” said Wor­ple, peer­ing short­sight­ed­ly up in­to Har­ry’s face. “I was say­ing to Pro­fes­sor Slughorn on­ly the oth­er day, ‘Where is the bi­og­ra­phy of Har­ry Pot­ter for which we have all been wait­ing?’”

“Er,” said Har­ry, “were you?”

“Just as mod­est as Ho­race de­scribed!” said Wor­ple. “But seri­ous­ly” — his man­ner changed; it be­came sud­den­ly busi­nesslike — “I would be de­light­ed to write it my­self— peo­ple are crav­ing to know more about you, dear boy, crav­ing! If you were pre­pared to grant me a few in­ter­views, say in four- or five­hour ses­sions, why, we could have the book fin­ished with­in months. And all with very lit­tle ef­fort on your part, I as­sure you — ask San­gui­ni here if it isn’t quite — San­gui­ni, stay here!” added Wor­ple, sud­den­ly stern, for the vam­pire had been edg­ing to­ward the near­by group of girls, a rather hun­gry look in his eye. “Here, have a pasty,” said Wor­ple, seiz­ing one from a pass­ing elf and stuff­ing it in­to San­gui­ni’s hand be­fore turn­ing his at­ten­tion back to Har­ry. “My dear boy, the gold you could make, you have no idea —”

“I’m def­inite­ly not in­ter­est­ed,” said Har­ry firm­ly, “and I’ve just seen a friend of mine, sor­ry.” He pulled Lu­na af­ter him in­to the crowd; he had in­deed just seen a long mane of brown hair dis­ap­pear be­tween what looked like two mem­bers of the Weird Sis­ters.

“Hermione! Hermione !”

“Har­ry! There you are, thank good­ness! Hi, Lu­na !”

“What’s hap­pened to you?” asked Har­ry, for Hermione looked dis­tinct­ly di­sheveled, rather as though she had just fought her way out of a thick­et of Dev­il’s Snare.

“Oh, I’ve just es­caped — I mean, I’ve just left Cor­mac,” she said. “Un­der the mis­tle­toe,” she added in ex­pla­na­tion, as Har­ry con­tin­ued to look ques­tion­ing­ly at her.

“Serves you right for com­ing with him,” he told her se­vere­ly. “I thought he’d an­noy Ron most,” said Hermione dis­pas­sion­ate­ly. “I de­bat­ed for a while about Zacharias Smith, but I thought, on the whole —”

“You con­sid­ered Smith?” said Har­ry, re­voked.

“Yes, I did, and I’m start­ing to wish I’d cho­sen him, McLaggen makes Grawp look a gen­tle­man. Let’s go this way, we’ll be able to see him com­ing, he’s so tall. . . .” The three of them made their way over to the oth­er side of the room, scoop­ing up gob­lets of mead on the way, re­al­iz­ing too late that Pro­fes­sor Trelawney was stand­ing there alone.

“Hel­lo,” said Lu­na po­lite­ly to Pro­fes­sor Trelawney.

“Good evening, my dear,” said Pro­fes­sor Trelawney, fo­cus­ing up­on Lu­na with some dif­fi­cul­ty. Har­ry could smell cook­ing sher­ry again. “I haven’t seen you in my class­es late­ly. ..”

“No, I’ve got Firen­ze this year,” said Lu­na.

“Oh, of course,” said Pro­fes­sor Trelawney with an an­gry, drunk­en tit­ter. “Or Dob­bin, as I pre­fer to think of him. You would have thought, would you not, that now I am re­turned to the school Pro­fes­sor Dum­ble­dore might have got rid of the horse? But no … we share class­es. . . . It’s an in­sult, frankly, an in­sult. Do you know. . .” Pro­fes­sor Trelawney seemed too tip­sy to have rec­og­nized Har­ry.

Un­der cov­er of her fu­ri­ous crit­icisms of Firen­ze, Har­ry drew clos­er to Hermione and said, “Let ‘ s get some­thing straight. Are you plan­ning to tell Ron that you in­ter­fered at Keep­er try­outs?”

Hermione raised her eye­brows. “Do you re­al­ly think I’d stoop that low?”

Har­ry looked at her shrewd­ly. “Hermione, if you can ask 0111 McLaggen —”

“There’s a dif­fer­ence,” said Hermione with dig­ni­ty. “I’ve got no plans to tell Ron any­thing about what might, or might not, have hap­pened at Keep­er try­outs.”

“Good,” said Har­ry fer­vent­ly. “Be­cause he’ll just fall apart again, and we’ll lose the next match —”

“Quid­ditch!” said Hermione an­gri­ly. “Is that all boys care about? Cor­mac hasn’t asked me one sin­gle ques­tion about my­self, no, I’ve just been treat­ed to ‘A Hun­dred Great Saves Made by Cor­mac McLaggen’ non­stop ev­er since — oh no, here he comes!” She moved so fast it was as though she had Dis­ap­pa­rat­ed; one mo­ment she was there, the next, she had squeezed be­tween two guf­faw­ing witch­es and van­ished.

“Seen Hermione?” asked McLaggen, forc­ing his way through the throng a minute lat­er.

“No, sor­ry,” said Har­ry, and he turned quick­ly to join in Lu­na’s con­ver­sa­tion, for­get­ting for a split sec­ond to whom she was talk­ing.

“Har­ry Pot­ter!” said Pro­fes­sor Trelawney in deep, vi­brant tones, not­ic­ing him for the first time.

“Oh, hel­lo,” said Har­ry un­en­thu­si­as­ti­cal­ly.

“My dear boy!” she said in a very car­ry­ing whis­per. “The ru­mors! The sto­ries! ‘The Cho­sen One’! Of course, I have known for a very long time. . . . The omens were nev­er good, Har­ry. . . But why have you not re­turned to Div­ina­tion? For you, of all peo­ple, the sub­ject is of the ut­most im­por­tance!”

“Ah, Sybi l l, we all think our sub­ject’s most im­por­tant!” said a loud voice, and Slughorn ap­peared at Pro­fes­sor Trelawney s oth­er side, his face very red, his vel­vet hat a lit­tle askew, a glass of mead in one hand and an enor­mous mince pie in the oth­er. “But I don’t t hink I’ve ev­er known such a nat­ural at Po­tions!” said Slughorn, re­gard­ing Har­ry with a fond, if blood­shot, eye. “In­stinc­tive, you know — like his moth­er! I’ve on­ly ev­er taught a few with this kind of abil­ity, I can tell you that, Sybi l l — why even Severus —” And to Har­ry’s hor­ror, Slughorn threw out an arm and seemed to scoop Snape out of thin air to­ward them. “Stop skulk­ing and come and join us, Severus!” hic­cuped Slughorn hap­pi­ly. “I was just talk­ing about Har­ry’s ex­cep­tion­al po­tion­mak­ing! Some cred­it must go to you, of course, you taught him for five years!”

Trapped, with Slughorns arm around his shoul­ders, Snape looked down his hooked nose at Har­ry, his black eyes nar­rowed. “Fun­ny, I nev­er had the im­pres­sion that I man­aged to teach Pot­ter any­thing at all.”

“Well, then, it’s nat­ural abil­ity!” shout­ed Slughorn. “You should have seen what he gave me, first les­son, Draught of Liv­ing Death — nev­er had a stu­dent pro­duce fin­er on a first at­tempt, I don’t think even you, Severus —”

“Re­al­ly?” said Snape qui­et­ly, his eyes still bor­ing in­to Har­ry, who felt a cer­tain dis­qui­et. The last thing he want­ed was for Snape to start in­ves­ti­gat­ing the source of his new­found bril­liance at Po­tions.

“Re­mind me what oth­er sub­jects you’re tak­ing, Har­ry?” asked Slughorn .

“De­fense Against the D ark Arts, Charms, Trans­fig­ura­tion , Her­bol­ogy…”

“All the sub­jects re­quired, in short, for an Au­ror ,” said Snap e with the faintest sneer.

“Yeah, well, that’s what I’d like to do,” said Har­ry de­fi­ant­ly.

“And a great one you’ll make too!” boomed Slughorn.

“I don’t think you should be an Au­ror, Har­ry,” said Lu­na un­ex pect­ed­ly. Ev­ery­body looked at her. “The Au­rors are part of the Rot­fang Con­spir­acy, I thought ev­ery­one knew that. They’re plan­ning to bring down the Min­istry of Mag­ic from with­in us­ing a c om bi­na­tion of Dark Mag­ic and gum dis­ease.”

Har­ry in­haled half his mead up his nose as he start­ed to lau gh. Re­al­ly, it had been worth bring­ing Lu­na just for this. Emerg­ing, from his gob­let, cough­ing, sop­ping wet but still grin­ning, he saw some­thing cal­cu­lat­ed to raise his spir­its even high­er: Dra­co Malf o y be­ing dragged by the ear to­ward them by Ar­gus Filch.

“Pro­fes­sor Slughorn,” wheezed Filch, his jowls aquiver and the ma­ni­acal light of mis­chiefde­tec­tion in his bulging eyes, “I dis­cov­ered this boy lurk­ing in an up­stairs cor­ri­dor. He claims to have been in­vit­ed to your par­ty and to have been de­layed in set­ting out. Did you is­sue him with an in­vi­ta­tion?”

Mal­foy pulled him­self free of Filchs grip, look­ing fu­ri­ous. “All right, I wasn’t in­vit­ed!” he said an­gri­ly. “I was try­ing to gate crash, hap­py?”

“No, I’m not!” said Filch, a state­ment at com­plete odds with the glee on his face. “You’re in trou­ble, you are! Didn’t the head­ma ster say that night­time prowl­ing ‘ s out, un­less you’ve got per­mis­sion, didn’t he, eh?”

“That’s all right, Ar­gus, that’s all right,” said Slughorn, wav­ing it 1.1 nd. “It’s Christ­mas, and it’s not a crime to want to come to a par­ty . Just this once, we’ll for­get any pun­ish­ment; you may stay , Dra­co.

Fil ich’s ex­pres­sion of out­raged dis­ap­point­ment was per­fect­ly pre di c t able; but why, Har­ry won­dered, watch­ing him, did Mal­foy look al­most equal­ly un­hap­py? And why was Snape look­ing at Mal­foy as though both an­gry and . . . was it p os­si­ble? … a lit tl afraid? But al­most be­fore Har­ry had reg­is­tered what he had seen, Filch had turned and shuf­fled away, mut­ter­ing un­der his breath; Mal­foy h ad com­posed his face in­to a smile and was thank­ing Slughorn for his gen­eros­ity, and Snape’s face was smooth­ly in­scrutable again.

“It’s noth­ing, noth­ing,” said Slughorn, wav­ing away Mal­foy’s t han­ks. “I did know your grand­fa­ther, af­ter all….”

“He al­ways spoke very high­ly of you, sir,” said Mal­foy quick­ly. “Said you were the best po­tion­mak­er he’d ev­er known. …”

Har­ry stared at Mal­foy. It was not the suck­in­gup that in­trigued him; he had watched Mal­foy do that to Snape for a long time. It was the fact that Mal­foy did, af­ter all, look a lit­tle ill. This was the first time he had seen Mal­foy close up for ages; he now saw that Mal­foy had dark shad­ows un­der his eyes and a dis­tinct­ly gray­ish tinge to his skin.

“I’d like a word with you, Dra­co,” said Snape sud­den­ly.

“Now , Severus,” said Slughorn, hic­cup­ing again, “it’s Christ mas, do n’t be too hard —”

“I am his Head of House, and I shall de­cide how hard, or oth­er­wise, to be,” said Snape curt­ly. “Fol­low me, Dra­co.”

They left, Snape lead­ing the way, Mal­foy look­ing re­sent­ful. Har­ry stood there for a mo­ment, ir­res­olute, then said, “I’ll be back in a bit, Lu­na — er — bath­room.”

“All right,” she said cheer­ful­ly, and he thought he heard her, as he hur­ried off in­to the crowd, re­sume the sub­ject of the Rot­fang Con­spir­acy with Pro­fes­sor Trelawney, who seemed sin­cere­ly in ter­est­ed. It was easy, once out of the par­ty, to pull his In­vis­ibil­ity Cloak out of his pock­et and throw it over him­self, for the cor­ri­dor was quite de­sert­ed. What was more dif­fi­cult was find­ing Snape and Mal­foy. Har­ry ran down the cor­ri­dor, the noise of his feet masked by the mu­sic and loud talk still is­su­ing from Slughorn’s of­fice be­hind him. Per­haps Snape had tak­en Mal­foy to his of­fice in the dun­geons … or per­haps he was es­cort­ing him back to the Slyt herin com­mon room. . . . Har­ry pressed his ear against door af­ter door as he dashed down the cor­ri­dor un­til, with a great jolt of ex­cite­ment, he crouched down to the key­hole of the last class­room in the cor­ri­dor and heard voic­es.

” . . . can­not af­ford mis­takes, Dra­co, be­cause if you are ex­pelled —”

“I didn’t have any­thing to do with it, all right?”

“I hope you are telling the truth, be­cause it was both clum­sy a nd fool­ish. Al­ready you are sus­pect­ed of hav­ing a hand in it.”

“Who sus­pects me?” said Mal­foy an­gri­ly. “For the last time, I didn’t do it, okay? That Bell girl must ‘ ve had an en­emy no on e knows about — don’t look at me like that! I know what you’re do­ing, I’m not stupid, but it won’t work — I can stop you!”

There was a pause and then Snape said qui­et­ly, “Ah . . . Aunt Bel­la­trix has been teach­ing you Oc­clu­men­cy, I see. What thoughts are you try­ing to con­ceal from your mas­ter, Dra­co?”

“I’m not try­ing to con­ceal any­thing from him, I just don’t want you butting in !” Har­ry pressed his ear still more close­ly against the key­hole. . . . What had hap­pened to make Mal­foy speak to Snape like this — Snape, to­ward whom he had al­ways shown re­spect, even lik­ing?

“So that is why you have been avoid­ing me this term? You have feared my in­ter­fer­ence? You re­al­ize that, had any­body else failed to come to my of­fice when I had told them re­peat­ed­ly to be there, Dra­co —”

“So put me in de­ten­tion! Re­port me to Dum­ble­dore!” jeered Mal­foy.

There was an­oth­er pause. Then Snape said, “You know per­fect­ly well that I do not wish to do ei­ther of those things .”

“You’d bet­ter stop telling me to come to your of­fice then!”

“Lis­ten to me,” said Snape, his voice so low now that Har­ry had to push his ear very hard against the key­hole to hear. “I am try­ing to help you. I swore to your moth­er I would pro­tect you. I made the Un­break­able Vow, Dra­co —”

“Looks like you’ll have to break it, then, be­cause I don’t need your pro­tec­tion! It’s my job, he gave it to me and I’m do­ing it, I’ve got a plan and it’s go­ing to work, it’s just tak­ing a bit longer than I thought it would!”

“What is your plan ?”

“It’s none of your busi­ness !”

” If you tell me what you are try­ing to do, I can as­sist you …”

“I have all the as­sis­tance I need, thanks, I’m not alone!”

“You were cer­tain­ly alone tonight, which was fool­ish in the ex­treme, wan­der­ing the cor­ri­dors with­out look­outs or back­up, these are el­emen­tary mis­takes —”

“I would’ve had Crabbe and Goyle with me if you hadn’t put them in de­ten­tion!”

“Keep your voice down!” spat Snape, for Mal­foy ‘ s voice had risen ex­cit­ed­ly. “If your friends Crabbe and Goyle in­tend to pass their De­fense Against the Dark Arts OWL this time around, they will need to work a lit­tle hard­er than they are do­ing at pres —”

“What does it mat­ter?” said Mal­foy. “De­fense Against the Dark Arts — its all just a joke, isn’t it, an act? Like any of us need pro­tect­ing against the Dark Arts —”

“It is an act that is cru­cial to suc­cess, Dra­co!” said Snape. “Where do you think I would have been all these years, if I had not known how to act? Now lis­ten to me! You are be­ing in­cau­tious, wan­der­ing around at night, get­ting your­self caught, and if you are plac­ing your re­liance in as­sis­tants like Crabbe and Goyle —”

“They’re not the on­ly ones, I’ve got oth­er peo­ple on my side, bet­ter peo­ple!”

“Then why not con­fide in me, and I can —”

“I know what you’re up to! You want to steal my glo­ry!”

There was an­oth­er pause, then Snape said cold­ly, “You are speak­ing like a child. I quite un­der­stand that your fa­thers cap­ture and im­pris­on­ment has up­set you, but —”

Har­ry had bare­ly a sec­ond ‘ s warn­ing; he heard Mal­foy’s foot­steps on the oth­er side of the door and flung him­self out of the way just as it burst open . Mal­foy was strid­ing away down the cor­ri­dor, past the open door of Slughorns of­fice, around the dis­tant cor­ner, and out of sight. Hard­ly dar­ing to breathe, Har­ry re­mained crouched down as Snape emerged slow­ly from the class­room. His ex­pres­sion un­fath­omable, he re­turned to the par­ty. Har­ry re­mained on the floor, hid­den be­neath the cloak, his mind rac­ing.
