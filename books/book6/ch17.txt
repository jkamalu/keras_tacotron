Chapter 17: A Sluggish Memory


Late in the af­ter­noon, a few days af­ter New Year, Har­ry, Ron, and Gin­ny lined up be­side the kitchen fire to re­turn to Hog­warts. The Min­istry had ar­ranged this one­off con­nec­tion to the Floo Net­work to re­turn stu­dents quick­ly and safe­ly to the school. On­ly Mrs. Weasley was there to say good­bye, as Mr. Weasley, Fred, George, Bill, and Fleur were all at work. Mrs. Weasley dis­solved in­to tears at the mo­ment of part­ing. Ad­mit­ted­ly, it took very lit­tle to set her off late­ly; she had been cry­ing on and off ev­er since Per­cy had stormed from the house on Christ­mas Day with his glass­es splat­tered with mashed parsnip (for which Fred, George, and Gin­ny all claimed cred­it).

“Don’t cry, Mum,” said Gin­ny, pat­ting her on the back as Mrs. Weasley sobbed in­to her shoul­der. “It’s okay. …”

“Yeah, don’t wor­ry about us,” said Ron, per­mit­ting his moth­er to plant a very wet kiss on his cheek, “or about Per­cy. He’s such a prat, it’s not re­al­ly a loss, is it?”

Mrs. Weasley sobbed hard­er than ev­er as she en­fold­ed Har­ry in her arms.

“Promise me you’ll look af­ter your­self.. .. Stay out of trou­ble. …”

“I al­ways do, Mrs. Weasley,” said Har­ry. “I like a qui­et life, you know me.”

She gave a wa­tery chuck­le and stood back. “Be good, then, all of you. …”

Har­ry stepped in­to the emer­ald fire and shout­ed “Hog­warts!” He had one last fleet­ing view of the Weasleys’ kitchen and Mrs. Weasley’s tear­ful face be­fore the flames en­gulfed him; spin­ning very fast, he caught blurred glimpses of oth­er Wiz­ard­ing rooms, which were whipped out of sight be­fore he could get a prop­er look; then he was slow­ing down, fi­nal­ly stop­ping square­ly in the fire­place in Pro­fes­sor McG­ona­gall’s of­fice. She bare­ly glanced up from her work as he clam­bered out over the grate.

“Evening, Pot­ter. Try not to get too much ash on the car­pet.”

“No, Pro­fes­sor.”

Har­ry straight­ened his glass­es and flat­tened his hair as Ron came spin­ning in­to view. When Gin­ny had ar­rived, all three of them trooped out of McG­ona­gall’s of­fice and off to­ward Gryffind­or Tow­er. Har­ry glanced out of the cor­ri­dor win­dows as they passed; the sun was al­ready sink­ing over grounds car­pet­ed in deep­er snow than had lain over the Bur­row gar­den. In the dis­tance, he could see Ha­grid feed­ing Buck­beak in front of his cab­in.

“Baubles,” said Ron con­fi­dent­ly, when they reached the Fat La­dy, who was look­ing rather paler than usu­al and winced at his loud voice.

“No,” she said.

“What d’you mean, ‘no’ ?

“There is a new pass­word,” she said. “And please don’t shout.”

“But we’ve been away, how’re we sup­posed to — ?”

“Har­ry! Gin­ny!”

Hermione was hur­ry­ing to­ward them, very pink­faced and wear­ing a cloak, hat, and gloves.

“I got back a cou­ple of hours ago, I’ve just been down to vis­it Ha­grid and Buck — I mean With­er­wings,” she said breath­less­ly. “Did you have a good Christ­mas?”

“Yeah,” said Ron at once, “pret­ty event­ful, Ru­fus Scrim —” ] “I’ve got some­thing for you, Har­ry,” said Hermione, nei­ther look­ing at Ron nor giv­ing any sign that she had heard him. “Oh, hang on — pass­word. Ab­sti­nence.”

“Pre­cise­ly,” said the Fat La­dy in a fee­ble voice, and swung for­ward to re­veal the por­trait hole.

“What’s up with her?” asked Har­ry.

“Overindulged over Christ­mas, ap­par­ent­ly,” said Hermione, rolling her eyes as she led the way in­to the packed com­mon room. “She and her friend Vi­olet drank their way through all the wine in that pic­ture of drunk monks down by the Charms cor­ri­dor. Any­way…”

She rum­maged in her pock­et for a mo­ment, then pulled out a scroll of parch­ment with Dum­ble­dore’s writ­ing on it.

“Great,” said Har­ry, un­rolling it at once to dis­cov­er that his next les­son with Dum­ble­dore was sched­uled for the fol­low­ing night. “I’ve got loads to tell him — and you. Let’s sit down —”

But at that mo­ment there was a loud squeal of “Won­Won!” and Laven­der Brown came hurtling out of nowhere and flung her­self in­to Ron’s arms. Sev­er­al on­look­ers snig­gered; Hermione gave a tin­kling laugh and said, “There’s a ca­ble over here… Com­ing. Gin­ny?”

“No, thanks, I said I’d meet Dean,” said Gin­ny, though Har­ry could not help not­ic­ing that she did not sound very en­thu­si­as­tic. Leav­ing Ron and Laven­der locked in a kind of ver­ti­cal wrestling, match, Har­ry led Hermione over to the spare ta­ble.

“So how was your Christ­mas?”

“Oh, fine,” she shrugged. “Noth­ing spe­cial. How was it at Won­Won’s?”

“I’ll tell you in a minute,” said Har­ry. “Look, Hermione, can’t you —”

“No, I can’t,” she said flat­ly. “So don’t even ask.”

“I thought maybe, you know, over Christ­mas —”

“It was the Fat La­dy who drank a vat of five­hun­dredyearold wine, Har­ry, not me. So what was this im­por­tant news you want­ed to tell me?”

She looked too fierce to ar­gue with at that mo­ment, so Har­ry dropped the sub­ject of Ron and re­count­ed all that he had over­heard be­tween Mal­foy and Snape. When he had fin­ished, Hermione sat in thought for a mo­ment and then said, “Don’t you think — ?”

“— he was pre­tend­ing to of­fer help so that he could trick Mal­foy in­to telling him what he’s do­ing?”

“Well, yes,” said Hermione.

“Ron’s dad and Lupin think so,” Har­ry said grudg­ing­ly. “But this def­inite­ly proves Mal­foy’s plan­ning some­thing, you can’t de­ny that.”

“No, I can’t,” she an­swered slow­ly.

“And he’s act­ing on Volde­mort’s or­ders, just like I said!”

“Hmm .. . did ei­ther of them ac­tu­al­ly men­tion Volde­mort’s name?”

Har­ry frowned, try­ing to re­mem­ber. “I’m not sure … Snape def­inite­ly said ‘your mas­ter,’ and who else would that be?”

“I don’t know,” said Hermione, bit­ing her lip. “Maybe his fa­ther?”

She stared across the room, ap­par­ent­ly lost in thought, not even not­ic­ing Laven­der tick­ling Ron. “How’s Lupin?”

“Not great,” said Har­ry, and he told her all about Lupin’s mis­sion among the were­wolves and the dif­fi­cul­ties he was fac­ing. “Have you heard of this Fen­rir Grey­back?”

“Yes, I have!” said Hermione, sound­ing star­tled. “And so have you, Har­ry!”

“When, His­to­ry of Mag­ic? You know full well I nev­er lis­tened …”

“No, no, not His­to­ry of Mag­ic — Mal­foy threat­ened Bor­gin with Kim!” said Hermione. “Back in Knock­turn Al­ley, don’t you re­mem­ber? He told Bor­gin that Grey­back was an old fam­ily friend and that he’d be check­ing up on Bor­gin’s progress!”

Har­ry gaped at her. “I for­got! But this proves Mal­foy s a Death Eater, how else could he be in con­tact with Grey­back and telling him what to do?”

“It is pret­ty sus­pi­cious,” breathed Hermione. “Un­less . . .” “Oh, come on,” said Har­ry in ex­as­per­ation, “you can’t get round this one!”

“Well . . . there is the pos­si­bil­ity it was an emp­ty threat.” “You’re un­be­liev­able, you are,” said Har­ry, shak­ing his head.

“We’ll see who’s right. . . . You’ll be eat­ing your words, Hermione, just like the Min­istry. Oh yeah, 1 had a row with Ru­fus Scrim­geour as well. . . .”

And the rest of the evening passed am­ica­bly with both of them abus­ing the Min­is­ter of Mag­ic, for Hermione, like Ron, thought that af­ter all the Min­istry had put Har­ry through the pre­vi­ous year, they had a great deal of nerve ask­ing him for help now.

The new term start­ed next morn­ing with a pleas­ant sur­prise for the sixth years: a large sign had been pinned to the com­mon room no­tice boards overnight.

AP­PARI­TION LESSONS

If you are sev­en­teen years of age, or will turn sev­en­teen on or be­fore the 31st Au­gust next, you are el­igi­ble for a twelve­week course of Ap­pari­tion Lessons from a Min­istry of Mag­ic Ap­pari­tion in­struc­tor. Please sign be­low if you would like to par­tic­ipate. Cost: 12 Galleons.

Har­ry and Ron joined the crowd that was jostling around the no­tice and tak­ing it in turns to write their names at the bot­tom. Ron was just tak­ing out his quill to sign af­ter Hermione when Laven­der crept up be­hind him, slipped her hands over his eyes, and trilled, “Guess who, Won­Won?” Har­ry turned to see Hermione stalk­ing off; he caught up with her, hav­ing no wish to stay be­hind with Ron and Laven­der, but to his sur­prise, Ron caught up with them on­ly a lit­tle way be­yond the por­trait hole, his ears bright red and his ex­pres­sion dis­grun­tled. With­out a word, Hermione sped up to walk with Neville.

“So — Ap­pari­tion,” said Ron, his tone mak­ing it per­fect­ly plain that Har­ry was not to men­tion what had just hap­pened. “Should be a laugh, eh?”

“I dun­no,” said Har­ry. “Maybe it’s bet­ter when you do it your­self, I didn’t en­joy it much when Dum­ble­dore took me along for the ride.”

“I for­got you’d al­ready done it. … I’d bet­ter pass my test first

time,” said Ron, look­ing anx­ious. “Fred and George did,” “Char­lie failed, though, didn’t he?” “Yeah, but Char­lie’s big­ger than me” — Ron held his arms out from his body as though he was a go­ril­la — “so Fred and George

didn’t go on about it much . . . not to his face any­way . . .” “When can we take the ac­tu­al test?” “Soon as we’re sev­en­teen. That’s on­ly March for me!” “Yeah, but you wouldn’t be able to Ap­pa­rate in here, not in the cas­tle . . .”

“Not the point, is it? Ev­ery­one would know I could Ap­pa­rate if I want­ed.”

Ron was not the on­ly one to be ex­cit­ed at the prospect of Ap­pari­tion. All that day there was much talk about the forth­com­ing , lessons; a great deal of store was set by be­ing able to van­ish and reap­pear at will.

“How cool will it be when we can just —” Sea­mus clicked his ringers to in­di­cate dis­ap­pear­an­ce. “Me cousin Fer­gus does it just to an­noy me, you wait till I can do it back. . . He’ll nev­er have an­oth­er peace­ful mo­ment. . . .”

Lost in vi­sions of this hap­py prospect, he flicked his wand a lit­tle too en­thu­si­as­ti­cal­ly, so that in­stead of pro­duc­ing the foun­tain of pure wa­ter that was the ob­ject of to­day’s Charms les­son, he let out a hose­like jet that ric­ocheted off the ceil­ing and knocked Pro­fes­sor Flitwick flat on his face.

“Har­ry’s al­ready Ap­pa­rat­ed,” Ron told a slight­ly abashed Sea­mus, af­ter Pro­fes­sor Flitwick had dried him­self off with a wave of his wand and set Sea­mus lines: “I am a wiz­ard, not a ba­boon bran­dish­ing a stick.” “Dum — er — some­one took him. Side­Alon­gAp­pari­tion, you know.”

“Whoa!” whis­pered Sea­mus, and he, Dean, and Neville put their heads a lit­tle clos­er to hear what Ap­pari­tion felt like. For the rest of the day, Har­ry was be­sieged with re­quests from the oth­er sixth years to de­scribe the sen­sa­tion of Ap­pari­tion. All of them seemed awed, rather than put off, when he told them how un­com­fort­able it was, and he was still an­swer­ing de­tailed ques­tions at ten to eight that evening, when he was forced to lie and say that he need­ed to re­turn a book to the li­brary, so as to es­cape in time for his les­son with Dum­ble­dore.

The lamps in Dum­ble­dore’s of­fice were lit, the por­traits of pre­vi­ous head­mas­ters were snor­ing gen­tly in their frames, and the Pen­sieve was ready up­on the desk once more. Dum­ble­dore’s hands lay on ei­ther side of it, the right one as black­ened and burnt­look­ing as ev­er. It did not seem to have healed at all and Har­ry won­dered, for per­haps the hun­dredth time, what had caused such a dis­tinc­tive in­ju­ry, but did not ask; Dum­ble­dore had said that he would know even­tu­al­ly and there was, in any case, an­oth­er sub­ject he want­ed to dis­cuss. But be­fore Har­ry could say any­thing about Snape and Mal­foy, Dum­ble­dore spoke.

“I hear that you met the Min­is­ter of Mag­ic over Christ­mas?” “Yes,” said Har­ry. “He’s not very hap­py with me.”

“No,” sighed Dum­ble­dore. “He is not very hap­py with me ei­ther. We must try not to sink be­neath our an­guish, Har­ry, but bat­tle on.”

Har­ry grinned.

“He want­ed me to tell the Wiz­ard­ing com­mu­ni­ty that the Min­istry’s do­ing a won­der­ful job.’

Dum­ble­dore smiled.

“It was Fudge’s idea orig­in­al­ly, you know. Dur­ing his last days in of­fice, when he was try­ing des­per­ate­ly to cling to his post, he sought a meet­ing with you, hop­ing that you would give him your

sup­port —”

“Af­ter ev­ery­thing Fudge did last year?” said Har­ry an­gri­ly. “Af­ter Um­bridge ?”

“I told Cor­nelius there was no chance of it, but the idea did not die when he left: of­fice. With­in hours of Scrim­geour’s ap­point­ment we met and he de­mand­ed that I ar­range a meet­ing with you —”

“So that’s why you ar­gued!” Har­ry blurt­ed out. “It was in the Dai­ly Prophet”‘

“The Prophet is bound to re­port the truth oc­ca­sion­al­ly,” said Dum­ble­dore, “if on­ly ac­ci­den­tal­ly. Yes, that was why we ar­gued. Well, it ap­pears that Ru­fus found a way to cor­ner you at last.”

“He ac­cused me of be­ing ‘Dum­ble­dore’s man through and through.’”

“How very rude of him.”

“I told him I was.”

Dum­ble­dore opened his mouth to speak and then closed it again. Be­hind Har­ry, Fawkes the phoenix let out a low, soft, mu­si­cal cry. To Har­ry’s in­tense em­bar­rass­ment, he sud­den­ly re­al­ized

that Dum­ble­dore’s bright blue eyes looked rather wa­tery, ami stared hasti­ly at his own knees. When Dum­ble­dore spoke, how­ev­er, his voice was quite steady.

“I am very touched, Har­ry.”

“Scrim­geour want­ed to know where you go when you’re not at Hog­warts,” said Har­ry, still look­ing fixed­ly at his knees.

“Yes, he is very nosy about that,” said Dum­ble­dore, now sound­ing cheer­ful, and Har­ry thought it safe to look up again. “He has even at­tempt­ed to have me fol­lowed. Amus­ing, re­al­ly. He set Dawlish to tail me. It wasn’t kind. I have al­ready been forced to jinx Dawlish once; I did it again with the great­est re­gret.”

“So they still don’t know where you go?” asked Har­ry, hop­ing for more in­for­ma­tion on this in­trigu­ing sub­ject, but Dum­ble­dore mere­ly smiled over the top of his half­moon spec­ta­cles.

“No, they don’t, and the time is not quite right for you to know ei­ther. Now, I sug­gest we press on, un­less there’s any­thing else — ?” “There is, ac­tu­al­ly, sir,” said Har­ry. “It’s about Mal­foy and Snape.”

“Pro­fes­sor Snape, Har­ry.”

“Yes, sir. I over­heard them dur­ing Pro­fes­sor Slughorns par­ty . . . well, I fol­lowed them, ac­tu­al­ly. …”

Dum­ble­dore lis­tened to Har­ry’s sto­ry with an im­pas­sive face. When Har­ry had fin­ished he did not speak for a few mo­ments, then said, “Thank you for telling me this, Har­ry, but I sug­gest that you put it out of your mind. I do not think that it is of great im­por­tance.”

“Not of great im­por­tance?” re­peat­ed Har­ry in­cred­ulous­ly. “Pro­fes­sor, did you un­der­stand — ?”

“Yes, Har­ry, blessed as I am with ex­traor­di­nary brain­pow­er, I un­der­stood ev­ery­thing you told me,” said Dum­ble­dore, a lit­tle sharply. “I think you might even con­sid­er the pos­si­bil­ity that I un­der­stood more than you did. Again, I am glad that you have con­lid­ed in me, but let me re­as­sure you that you have not told me any­thing that caus­es me dis­qui­et.”

Har­ry sat in seething si­lence, glar­ing at Dum­ble­dore. What was go­ing on? Did this mean that Dum­ble­dore had in­deed or­dered Snape to find out what Mal­foy was do­ing, in which case he had al­ready heard ev­ery­thing Har­ry had just told him from Snape? Or was he re­al­ly wor­ried by what he had heard, but pre­tend­ing not to be?

“So, sir,” said Har­ry, in what he hoped was a po­lite, calm voice, “you def­inite­ly still trust — ?”

“I have been tol­er­ant enough to an­swer that ques­tion al­ready,” said Dum­ble­dore, but he did not sound very tol­er­ant any­more. “My an­swer has not changed.”

“I should think not,” said a snide voice; Phineas Nigel­lus was ev­ident­ly on­ly pre­tend­ing to be asleep. Dum­ble­dore ig­nored him.

“And now, Har­ry, I must in­sist that we press on. I have more im­por­tant things to dis­cuss with you this evening.”

Har­ry sat there feel­ing mu­ti­nous. How would it be if he re­fused to per­mit the change of sub­ject, if he in­sist­ed up­on ar­gu­ing the case against Mal­foy? As though he had read Har­ry’s mind, Dum­ble­dore shook his head.

“Ah, Har­ry, how of­ten this hap­pens, even be­tween the best of friends! Each of us be­lieves that what he has to say is much more im­por­tant than any­thing the oth­er might have to con­trib­ute!”

“I don’t think what you’ve got to say is unim­por­tant, sir,” said Har­ry stiffly.

“Well, you are quite right, be­cause it is not,” said Dum­ble­dore briskly. “I have two more mem­ories to show you this evening, both ob­tained with enor­mous dif­fi­cul­ty, and the sec­ond of them is, 1 think, the most im­por­tant I have col­lect­ed.”

Har­ry did not say any­thing to this; he still felt an­gry at the re­cep­tion his con­fi­dences had re­ceived, but could not see what was to be gained by ar­gu­ing fur­ther.

“So,” said Dum­ble­dore, in a ring­ing voice, “we meet this evening to con­tin­ue the tale of Tom Rid­dle, whom we left last les­son poised on the thresh­old of his years at Hog­warts. You will re­mem­ber how ex­cit­ed he was to hear that he was a wiz­ard, that he re­fused my com­pa­ny on a trip to Di­agon Al­ley, and that I, in turn, warned him against con­tin­ued thiev­ery when he ar­rived at school.

“Well, the start of the school year ar­rived and with it came Tom Rid­dle, a qui­et boy in his sec­ond­hand robes, who lined up with the oth­er first years to be sort­ed. He was placed in Slytherin House al­most the mo­ment that the Sort­ing Hat touched his head,” con­tin­ued Dum­ble­dore, wav­ing his black­ened hand to­ward the shelf over his head where the Sort­ing Hat sat, an­cient and un­mov­ing. “How soon Rid­dle learned that the fa­mous founder of the House could talk to snakes, I do not know — per­haps that very evening. The knowl­edge can on­ly have ex­cit­ed him and in­creased his sense of self­im­por­tance.

“How­ev­er, if he was fright­en­ing or im­press­ing fel­low Slytherins with dis­plays of Parsel­tongue in their com­mon room, no hint of it reached the staff. He showed no sign of out­ward ar­ro­gance or ag­gres­sion at all. As an un­usu­al­ly tal­ent­ed and very good­look­ing or­phan, he nat­ural­ly drew at­ten­tion and sym­pa­thy from the staff al­most from the mo­ment of his ar­ri­val. He seemed po­lice, qui­et, and thirsty for knowl­edge. Near­ly all were most fa­vor­ably im­pressed by him.”

“Didn’t you tell them, sir, what he’d been like when you met him at the or­phan­age?” asked Har­ry.

“No, I did not. Though he had shown no hint of re­morse, it was pos­si­ble that he felt sor­ry for how he had be­haved be­fore and was re­solved to turn over a fresh leaf. I chose to give him that chance.”

Dum­ble­dore paused and looked in­quir­ing­ly at Har­ry, who had opened his mouth to speak. Here, again, was Dum­ble­dore’s ten­den­cy to trust peo­ple in spite of over­whelm­ing ev­idence that they did not de­serve it! But then Har­ry re­mem­bered some­thing. . . .

“But you didn’t re­al­ly trust him, sir, did you? He told me . . . the Rid­dle who came out of that di­ary said, ‘Dum­ble­dore nev­er seemed to like me as much as the oth­er teach­ers did.’”

“Let us say that I did not take it for grant­ed that he was trust­wor­thy,” said Dum­ble­dore. “I had, as I have al­ready in­di­cat­ed, re­solved to keep a close eye up­on him, and so I did. I can­not pre­tend that I gleaned a great deal from my ob­ser­va­tions at first. He was very guard­ed with me; he felt, I am sure, that in the thrill of dis­cov­er­ing his true iden­ti­ty he had told me a lit­tle too much. He was care­ful nev­er to re­veal as much again, but he could not take back what he had let slip in his ex­cite­ment, nor what Mrs. Cole had con­fid­ed in me. How­ev­er, he had the sense nev­er to try and charm me as he charmed so many of my col­leagues.

“As he moved up the school, he gath­ered about him a group of ded­icat­ed friends; I call them that, for want of a bet­ter term, al­though as I have al­ready in­di­cat­ed, Rid­dle un­doubt­ed­ly felt no af­fec­tion for any of them. This group had a kind of dark glam­our with­in the cas­tle. They were a mot­ley col­lec­tion; a mix­ture of the weak seek­ing pro­tec­tion, the am­bi­tious seek­ing some shared glo­ry, and the thug­gish grav­itat­ing to­ward a lead­er who could show them more re­fined forms of cru­el­ty. In oth­er words, they were the fore­run­ners of the Death Eaters, and in­deed some of them be­came the first Death Eaters af­ter leav­ing Hog­warts.

“Rigid­ly con­trolled by Rid­dle, they were nev­er de­tect­ed in open wrong­do­ing, al­though their sev­en years at Hog­warts were marked by a num­ber of nasty in­ci­dents to which they were nev­er sat­is­fac­to­ri­ly linked, the most se­ri­ous of which was, of course, the open­ing of the Cham­ber of Se­crets, which re­sult­ed in the death of a girl. As you know, Ha­grid was wrong­ly ac­cused of that crime.

“I have not been able to find many mem­ories of Rid­dle at Hog­warts,” said Dum­ble­dore, plac­ing his with­ered hand on the Pen­sieve. “Few who knew him then are pre­pared to talk about him; they are too ter­ri­fied. What I know, I found out af­ter he had left Hog­warts, af­ter much painstak­ing ef­fort, af­ter trac­ing those few who could be tricked in­to speak­ing, af­ter search­ing old records and ques­tion­ing Mug­gle and wiz­ard wit­ness­es alike.

“Those whom I could per­suade to talk told me that Rid­dle was ob­sessed with his par­ent­age. This is un­der­stand­able, of course; he had grown up in an or­phan­age and nat­ural­ly wished to know how he came to be there. It seems that he searched in vain for some trace of Tom Rid­dle se­nior on the shields in the tro­phy room, on the lists of pre­fects in the old school records, even in the books of Wiz­ard­ing his­to­ry. Fi­nal­ly he was forced to ac­cept that his fa­ther had nev­er set foot in Hog­warts. I be­lieve that it was then that he dropped the name for­ev­er, as­sumed the iden­ti­ty of Lord Volde­mort, and be­gan his in­ves­ti­ga­tions in­to his pre­vi­ous­ly de­spised moth­er’s fam­ily — the wom­an whom, you will re­mem­ber, he had thought could not be a witch if she had suc­cumbed to the shame­ful hu­man weak­ness of death.

“All he had to go up­on was the sin­gle name ‘Mar­vo­lo,’ which he knew from those who ran the or­phan­age had been his moth­er’s fa­ther’s name. Fi­nal­ly, af­ter painstak­ing re­search, through old books of Wiz­ard­ing fam­ilies, he dis­cov­ered the ex­is­tence of Slytherin’s sur­viv­ing line. In the sum­mer of his six­teenth year, he left the or­phan­age to which he re­turned an­nu­al­ly and set off to find his Gaunt rel­atives. And now, Har­ry, if you will stand …” :

Dum­ble­dore rose, and Har­ry saw that he was again hold­ing a. small crys­tal bot­tle filled with swirling, pearly mem­ory.

“I was very lucky to col­lect this,” he said, as he poured the gleam­ing mass in­to the Pen­sieve. “As you will un­der­stand when we have ex­pe­ri­enced it. Shall we?”

Har­ry stepped up to the stone basin and bowed obe­di­ent­ly un­til his face sank through the sur­face of the mem­ory; he felt the fa­mil­iar sen­sa­tion of falling through noth­ing­ness and then land­ed up­on a dirty stone floor in al­most to­tal dark­ness.

It took him sev­er­al sec­onds to rec­og­nize the place, by which time Dum­ble­dore had land­ed be­side him. The Gaunts’ house was now more in­de­scrib­ably filthy than any­where Har­ry had ev­er seen. The ceil­ing was thick with cob­webs, the floor coat­ed in grime; moldy and rot­ting food lay up­on the ta­ble amidst a mass of crust­ed pots. The on­ly light came from a sin­gle gut­ter­ing can­dle placed at the feet of a man with hair and beard so over­grown Har­ry could see nei­ther eyes nor mouth. He was slumped in an arm­chair by the fire, and Har­ry won­dered for a mo­ment whether he was dead. But

then there came a loud knock on the door and the man jerked awake, rais­ing a wand in his right hand and a short knife in his left.

The door creaked open. There on the thresh­old, hold­ing an old­fash­ioned lamp, stood a boy Har­ry rec­og­nized at once: tall, pale, dark­haired, and hand­some — the teenage Volde­mort.

Volde­mort’s eyes moved slow­ly around the hov­el and then found the man in the arm­chair. For a few sec­onds they looked at each oth­er, then the man stag­gered up­right, the many emp­ty bot­tles at his feet clat­ter­ing and tin­kling across the floor.

“YOU!” he bel­lowed. “YOU!”

And he hur­tled drunk­en­ly at Rid­dle, wand and knife held aloft.

“Stop.”

Rid­dle spoke in Parsel­tongue. The man skid­ded in­to the ta­ble, send­ing moldy pots crash­ing to the floor. He stared at Rid­dle. There was a long si­lence while they con­tem­plat­ed each oth­er. The man broke it.

“You speak it?”

“Yes, I speak it,” said Rid­dle. He moved for­ward in­to the room, al­low­ing the door to swing shut be­hind him. Har­ry could not help but feel a re­sent­ful ad­mi­ra­tion for Volde­mort’s com­plete lack of fear. His race mere­ly ex­pressed dis­gust and, per­haps, dis­ap­point­ment.

“Where is Mar­vo­lo?” he asked.

“Dead,” said the oth­er. “Died years ago, didn’t he?”

Rid­dle frowned.

“Who are you, then?”

“I’m Morfin, ain’t I?”

“Mar­vo­lo’s son?”

“‘Course I am, then…” • ,, .

Morfin pushed the hair out of his dirty face, the bet­ter to see Rid­dle, and Har­ry saw that he wore Mar­vo­lo’s black­stoned ring on his right hand.

“I thought you was that Mug­gle,” whis­pered Morfin. “You look mighty like that Mug­gle.”

“What Mug­gle?” said Rid­dle sharply.

“That Mug­gle what my sis­ter took a fan­cy to, that Mug­gle what lives in the big house over the way,” said Morfin, and he spat un­ex­pect­ed­ly up­on the floor be­tween them. “You look right like him. Rid­dle. But he’s old­er now, in ‘e? He’s old­er’n you, now I think on it. …”

Morfin looked slight­ly dazed and swayed a lit­tle, still clutch­ing the edge of the ta­ble for sup­port. “He come back, see,” he added stupid­ly.

Volde­mort was gaz­ing at Morfin as though ap­prais­ing his pos­si­bil­ities. Now he moved a lit­tle clos­er and said, “Rid­dle came back?”

“Ar, he left her, and serve her right, mar­ry­ing filth!” said Morfin, spit­ting on the floor again. “Robbed us, mind, be­fore she ran off. , Where’s the lock­et, eh, where’s Slytherin’s lock­et?”

Volde­mort did not an­swer. Morfin was work­ing him­self in­to a rage again; he bran­dished his knife and shout­ed, “Dis­hon­ored us, , she did, that lit­tle slut! And whore you, com­ing here and ask­ing ques­tions about all that? It’s over, in­nit. . . . It’s over. …”

He looked away, stag­ger­ing slight­ly, and Volde­mort moved for­ward. As he did so, an un­nat­ural dark­ness fell, ex­tin­guish­ing Volde­mort’s lamp and Morfin’s can­dle, ex­tin­guish­ing ev­ery­thing. . . . Dum­ble­dore’s fin­gers closed tight­ly around Har­ry’s arm and they were soar­ing back in­to the present again. The soft gold­en light in Dum­ble­dore’s of­fice seemed to daz­zle Har­ry’s eyes af­ter that im­pen­etra­ble dark­ness.

“Is that all?” said Har­ry at once. “Why did it go dark, what hap­pened?”

“Be­cause Morfin could not re­mem­ber any­thing from that point on­ward,” said Dum­ble­dore, ges­tur­ing Har­ry back in­to his seat. “When he awoke next morn­ing, he was ly­ing on the floor, quite alone. Mar­vo­lo’s ring had gone.

“Mean­while, in the vil­lage of Lit­tle Hangle­ton, a maid was run­ning along the High Street, scream­ing that there were three bod­ies ly­ing in the draw­ing room of the big house: Tom Rid­dle Se­nior and his moth­er and fa­ther.

“The Mug­gle au­thor­ities were per­plexed. As far as I am aware, they do not know to this day how the Rid­dles died, for the Avadu Ke­davra curse does not usu­al­ly leave any sign of dam­age. . . . The ex­cep­tion sits be­fore me,” Dum­ble­dore added, with a nod to Har­ry’s scar. “The Min­istry, on the oth­er hand, knew at once that this was a wiz­ard’s mur­der. They al­so knew that a con­vict­ed Mug­gle­hater lived across the val­ley from the Rid­dle house, a Mug­gle­hater who had al­ready been im­pris­oned once for at­tack­ing one of the mur­dered peo­ple.

“So the Min­istry called up­on Morfin. They did not need to ques­tion him, to use Ver­itaserum or Legili­men­cy. He ad­mit­ted to the mur­der on the spot, giv­ing de­tails on­ly the mur­der­er could know. He was proud, he said, to have killed the Mug­gles, had been await­ing his chance all these years. He hand­ed over his wand, which was proved at once to have been used to kill the Rid­dles. And he per­mit­ted him­self to be led off to Azk­aban with­out a fight.

All that dis­turbed him was the fact that his fa­thers ring had dis­ap­peared. ‘He’ll kill me for los­ing it,’ he told his cap­tors over and over again. ‘He’ll kill me for los­ing his ring.’ And that, ap­par­ent­ly, was all he ev­er said again. He lived out the re­main­der of his life in Azk­aban, lament­ing the loss of Mar­vo­lo’s last heir­loom, and is buried be­side the prison, along­side the oth­er poor souls who have ex­pired with­in its walls.”

“So Volde­mort stole Morfin’s wand and used it?” said Har­ry, sit­ting up straight.

“That’s right,” said Dum­ble­dore. “We have no mem­ories to show us this, but I think we can be fair­ly sure what hap­pened. Volde­mort Stu­pe­fied his un­cle, took his wand, and pro­ceed­ed across the val­ley to ‘the big house over the way.’ There he mur­dered the Mug­gle man who had aban­doned his witch moth­er, and, for good mea­sure, his Mug­gle grand­par­ents, thus oblit­er­at­ing the last of the un­wor­thy Rid­dle line and re­veng­ing him­self up­on the fa­ther who nev­er want­ed him. Then he re­turned to the Gaunt hov­el, per­formed the com­plex bit of mag­ic that would im­plant a false mem­ory in his un­cle’s mind, laid Morfin’s wand be­side its un­con­scious own­er, pock­et­ed the an­cient ring he wore, and de­part­ed.”

“And Morfin nev­er re­al­ized he hadn’t done it?”

“Nev­er,” said Dum­ble­dore. “He gave, as I say, a full and boast­ful con­fes­sion.”

“But he had this re­al mem­ory in him all the time!” “Yes, but it took a great deal of skilled Legili­men­cy to coax it out of him,” said Dum­ble­dore, “and why should any­body delve fur­ther in­to Morfin’s mind when he had al­ready con­fessed to the crime? How­ev­er, I was able to se­cure a vis­it to Morfin in the last weeks of his life, by which time I was at­tempt­ing to dis­cov­er as much as I could about Volde­mort’s past. I ex­tract­ed this mem­ory with dif­fi­cul­ty. When I saw what it con­tained, I at­tempt­ed to use it to se­cure Morfin’s re­lease from Azk­aban. Be­fore the Min­istry reached their de­ci­sion, how­ev­er, Morfin had died.”

“But how come the Min­istry didn’t re­al­ize that Volde­mort had done all that to Morfin?” Har­ry asked an­gri­ly “He was un­der­age at the time, wasn’t he? I thought they could de­tect un­der­age mag­ic!” “You are quite right — they can de­tect mag­ic, but not the per­pe­tra­tor: You will re­mem­ber that you were blamed by the Min­istry for the Hov­er Charm that was, in fact, cast by —”

“Dob­by,” growled Har­ry; this in­jus­tice still ran­kled. “So if you’re un­der­age and you do mag­ic in­side an adult witch or wiz­ard’s house, the Min­istry won’t know?”

“They will cer­tain­ly be un­able to tell who per­formed the mag­ic,” said Dum­ble­dore, smil­ing slight­ly at the look of great in­dig­na­tion on Har­rys face. “They re­ly on witch and wiz­ard par­ents to en­force their off­spring’s obe­di­ence while with­in their walls.”

“Well, that’s rub­bish,” snapped Har­ry. “Look what hap­pened here, look what hap­pened to Morfin!”

“I agree,” said Dum­ble­dore. “What­ev­er Morfin was, he did not de­serve to die as he did, blamed for mur­ders he had not com­mit­ted. But it is get­ting late, and I want you to see this oth­er mem­ory be­fore we part. …”

Dum­ble­dore took from an in­side pock­et an­oth­er crys­tal phial and Har­ry fell silent at once, re­mem­ber­ing that Dum­ble­dore had said it was the most im­por­tant one he had col­lect­ed. Har­ry no­ticed that the con­tents proved dif­fi­cult to emp­ty in­to the Pen­sieve, as though they had con­gealed slight­ly; did mem­ories go bad?

“This will not take long,” said Dum­ble­dore, when he had fi­nal­ly emp­tied the phial. “We shall be back be­fore you know it. Once more in­to the Pen­sieve, then . . .”

And Har­ry fell again through the sil­ver sur­face, land­ing this time right in front of a man he rec­og­nized at once.

It was a much younger Ho­race Slughorn. Har­ry was so used to him bald that he found the sight of Slughorn with thick, shiny, straw­col­ored hair quite dis­con­cert­ing; it looked as though he had had his head thatched, though there was al­ready a shiny Galleon­sized bald patch on his crown. His mus­tache, less mas­sive than it was these days, was gin­gery­blond. He was not quite as ro­tund as the Slughorn Har­ry knew, though the gold­en but­tons on his rich­ly em­broi­dered waist­coat were tak­ing a fair amount of strain. His lit­tle feet rest­ing up­on a vel­vet pouffe, he was sit­ting well back in a com­fort­able winged arm­chair, one hand grasp­ing a small glass of wine, the oth­er search­ing through a box of crys­tal­ized pineap­ple.

Har­ry looked around as Dum­ble­dore ap­peared be­side him and saw that they were stand­ing in Slughorn’s of­fice. Haifa dozen boys were sit­ting around Slughorn, all on hard­er or low­er seats than his, and all in their mid­teens. Har­ry rec­og­nized Volde­mort at once. His was the most hand­some face and he looked the most re­laxed of all the boys. His right hand lay neg­li­gent­ly up­on the arm of his chair; with a jolt, Har­ry saw that he was wear­ing Mar­vo­lo’s goldand­black ring; he had al­ready killed his fa­ther.

“Sir, is it true that Pro­fes­sor Mer­ry­thought is re­tir­ing?” he asked.

“Tom, Tom, if I knew I couldn’t tell you,” said Slughorn, wag­ging a re­prov­ing, sug­ar­cov­ered fin­ger at Rid­dle, though ru­in­ing the ef­fect slight­ly by wink­ing. “I must say, I’d like to know where you get your in­for­ma­tion, boy, more knowl­edge­able than half the staff, you are.”

Rid­dle smiled; the oth­er boys laughed and cast him ad­mir­ing looks.

“What with your un­can­ny abil­ity to know things you shouldn’t, and your care­ful flat­tery of the peo­ple who mat­ter — thank you fm the pineap­ple, by the way, you’re quite right, it is my fa­vorite — “

As sev­er­al of the boys tit­tered, some­thing very odd hap­pened. The whole room was sud­den­ly filled with a thick white fog, so that Har­ry could see noth­ing but the face of Dum­ble­dore, who was stand­ing be­side him. Then Slughorn’s voice rang out through the mist, un­nat­ural­ly loud­ly, “You’ll go wrong, boy, mark my words. “

The fog cleared as sud­den­ly as it had ap­peared and yet no­body made any al­lu­sion to it, nor did any­body look as though any­thing un­usu­al had just hap­pened. Be­wil­dered, Har­ry looked around as a small gold­en clock stand­ing up­on Slughorn’s desk chimed eleven o’clock.

“Good gra­cious, is it that time al­ready?” said Slughorn. “You’d bet­ter get go­ing, boys, or we’ll all be in trou­ble. Lestrange, I want your es­say by to­mor­row or it’s de­ten­tion. Same goes for you, Av­ery.”

Slughorn pulled him­self out of his arm­chair and car­ried his emp­ty glass over to his desk as the boys filed out. Volde­mort, how­ev­er, stayed be­hind. Har­ry could tell he had daw­dled de­lib­er­ate­ly, want­ing to be last in the room with Slughorn.

“Look sharp, Tom,” said Slughorn, turn­ing around and find­ing him still present. “You don’t want to be caught out of bed out of hours, and you a pre­fect…”

“Sir, I want­ed to ask you some­thing.”

“Ask away, then, m’boy, ask away….”

“Sir, I won­dered what you know about. . . about Hor­crux­es?”

And it hap­pened all over again: The dense fog filled the room so that Har­ry could not see Slughorn or Volde­mort at all; on­ly Dum­ble­dore, smil­ing serene­ly be­side him. Then Slughorn’s voice boomed out again, just as it had done be­fore.

“I don’t know any­thing about Hor­crux­es and I wouldn’t tell you if I did! Now get out of here at once and don’t let me catch you men­tion­ing them again!”

“Well, that’s that,” said Dum­ble­dore placid­ly be­side Har­ry.

“Time to go.”

And Har­ry’s feet left the floor to fall, sec­onds lat­er, back on­to the

rug in front of Dum­ble­dore’s desk.

“That’s all there is?” said Har­ry blankly.

Dum­ble­dore had said that this was the most im­por­tant mem­ory of all, but he could not see what was so sig­nif­icant about it. Ad­mit­ted­ly the fog, and the fact that no­body seemed to have no­ticed it, was odd, but oth­er than that noth­ing seemed to have hap­pened ex­cept that Volde­mort had asked a ques­tion and failed to get an an­swer.

“As you might have no­ticed,” said Dum­ble­dore, re­seat­ing him­self be­hind his desk, “that mem­ory has been tam­pered with.”

“Tam­pered with?” re­peat­ed Har­ry, sit­ting back down too.

“Cer­tain­ly,” said Dum­ble­dore. “Pro­fes­sor Slughorn has med­dled with his own rec­ol­lec­tions.”

“But why would he do that?”

“Be­cause, I think, he is ashamed of what he re­mem­bers,” said Dum­ble­dore. “He has tried to re­work the mem­ory to show him­self in a bet­ter light, oblit­er­at­ing those parts which he does not wish me to see. It is, as you will have no­ticed, very crude­ly done, and that is all to the good, for it shows that the true mem­ory is still there be­neath the al­ter­ations.

“And so, for the first time, I am giv­ing you home­work, Har­ry. It will be your job to per­suade Pro­fes­sor Slughorn to di­vulge the re­al mem­ory, which will un­doubt­ed­ly be our most cru­cial piece of in­for­ma­tion of all.”

Har­ry stared at him.

“But sure­ly, sir,” he said, keep­ing his voice as re­spect­ful as pos­si­ble, “you don’t need me — you could use Legili­men­cy … or Ver­itaserum. …”

“Pro­fes­sor Slughorn is an ex­treme­ly able wiz­ard who will be ex­pect­ing both,” said Dum­ble­dore. “He is much more ac­com­plished at Oc­clu­men­cy than poor Morfin Gaunt, and I would be as­ton­ished if he has not car­ried an an­ti­dote to Ver­itaserum with him ev­er since I co­erced him in­to giv­ing me this trav­es­ty of a rec­ol­lec­tion.

“No, I think it would be fool­ish to at­tempt to wrest the truth from Pro­fes­sor Slughorn by force, and might do much more harm than good; I do not wish him to leave Hog­warts. How­ev­er, he has his weak­ness­es like the rest of us, and I be­lieve that you are the one per­son who might be able to pen­etrate his de­fens­es. It is most im­por­tant that we se­cure the true mem­ory, Har­ry. . . . How im­por­tant, we will on­ly know when we have seen the re­al thing. So, good luck . . . and good night.”

A lit­tle tak­en aback by the abrupt dis­missal, Har­ry got to his feet quick­ly. “Good night, sir.”

As he closed the study door be­hind him, he dis­tinct­ly heard Phineas Nigel­lus say, “I can’t see why the boy should be able to do it bet­ter than you, Dum­ble­dore.”

“I wouldn’t ex­pect you to, Phineas,” replied Dum­ble­dore, and Fawkes gave an­oth­er low, mu­si­cal cry.
