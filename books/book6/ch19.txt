Chapter 19: Elf Tails


So, all in all, not one of Ron’s bet­ter birth­days?” said Fred.

It was evening; the hos­pi­tal wing was qui­et, the win­dows cur­tained, the lamps lit. Ron’s was the on­ly oc­cu­pied bed. Har­ry, Hermione, and Gin­ny were sit­ting around him; they had spent all day wait­ing out­side the dou­ble doors, try­ing to see in­side when­ev­er some­body went in or out. Madam Pom­frey had on­ly let them en­ter at eight o’clock. Fred and George had ar­rived at ten past.

“This isn’t how we imag­in­ed hand­ing over our present,” said George grim­ly, putting down a large wrapped gift on Ron’s bed­side cab­in­et and sit­ting be­side Gin­ny.

“Yeah, when we pic­tured the scene, he was con­scious,” said Fred.

“There we were in Hogsmeade, wait­ing to sur­prise him —” said George.

“You were in Hogsmeade?” asked Gin­ny, look­ing up.

“We were think­ing of buy­ing Zonko’s,” said Fred gloo­mi­ly. “A Hogsmeade branch, you know, but a fat lot of good it’ll do us if you lot aren’t al­lowed out at week­ends to buy our stuff any­mon … But nev­er mind that now.”

He drew up a chair be­side Har­ry and looked at Ron’s pale face.

“How ex­act­ly did it hap­pen, Har­ry?”

Har­ry re­told the sto­ry he had al­ready re­count­ed, it felt like a hun­dred times to Dum­ble­dore, to McG­ona­gall, to Madam Pom­frey, to Hermione, and to Gin­ny.

“. . . and then I got the be­zoar down his throat and his breath­ing eased up a bit, Slughorn ran for help, McG­ona­gall and Madam Pom­frey turned up, and they brought Ron up here. They reck­on he’ll be all right. Madam Pom­frey says he’ll have to stay here a week or so … keep tak­ing essence of rue . . .”

“Blimey, it was lucky you thought of a be­zoar,” said George in a low voice.

“Lucky there was one in the room,” said Har­ry, who kept turn­ing cold at the thought of what would have hap­pened if he had not been able to lay hands on the lit­tle stone.

Hermione gave an al­most in­au­di­ble sniff. She had been ex­cep­tion­al­ly qui­et all day. Hav­ing hur­tled, white­faced, up to Har­ry out­side the hos­pi­tal wing and de­mand­ed to know what had hap­pened., she had tak­en al­most no part in Har­ry and Gin­ny’s ob­ses­sive dis­cus­sion about how Ron had been poi­soned, but mere­ly stood be­side them, clench­jawed and fright­ened­look­ing, un­til ai last they had been al­lowed in to see him.

“Do Mum and Dad know?” Fred asked Gin­ny. “They’ve al­ready seen him, they ar­rived an hour ago — they’re in Dum­ble­dore’s of­fice now, but they’ll be back soon. . . .”

There was a pause while they all watched Ron mum­ble a lit­tle in his sleep.

“So the poi­son was in the drink?” said Fred qui­et­ly.

“Yes,” said Har­ry at once; he could think of noth­ing else and was glad for the op­por­tu­ni­ty to start dis­cussing it again. “Slughorn poured it out —”

“Would he have been able to slip some­thing in­to Ron’s glass with­out you see­ing?”

“Prob­ably,” said Har­ry, “but why would Slughorn want to poi­son Ron?”

“No idea,” said Fred, frown­ing. “You don’t think he could have mixed up the glass­es by mis­take? Mean­ing to get you?”

“Why would Slughorn want to poi­son Har­ry?” asked Gin­ny. “I dun­no,” said Fred, “but there must be loads of peo­ple who’d like to poi­son Har­ry, mustn’t there? ‘The Cho­sen One’ and all that?” “So you think Slughorn’s a Death Eater?” said Gin­ny. :,

“Any­thing’s pos­si­ble,” said Fred dark­ly. “He could be un­der the Im­perius Curse,” said George. “Or he could be in­no­cent,” said Gin­ny. “The poi­son could have been in the bot­tle, in which case it was prob­ably meant for Slughorn him­self.”

“Who’d want to kill Slughorn?”

“Dum­ble­dore reck­ons Volde­mort want­ed Slughorn on his side,” said Har­ry. “Slughorn was in hid­ing for a year be­fore he came to Hog­warts. And . . .” He thought of the mem­ory Dum­ble­dore had not yet been able to ex­tract from Slughorn. “And maybe Volde­mort wants him out of the way, maybe he thinks he could be valu­able to Dum­ble­dore.”

“But you said Slughorn had been plan­ning to give th.u Un­tie to Dum­ble­dore for Christ­mas,” Gin­ny re­mind­ed him. “So the poi­son­er could just as eas­ily have been af­ter Dum­ble­dore.”

“Then the poi­son­er didn’t know Slughorn very well,” said Hermione, speak­ing for the first time in hours and sound­ing as though she had a bad head cold. “Any­one who knew Slughorn would have I known there was a good chance he’d keep some­thing that tasty for him­self.” I

“Ermynee,” croaked Ron un­ex­pect­ed­ly from be­tween them

They all fell silent, watch­ing him anx­ious­ly, but af­ter mut­ter­ing in­com­pre­hen­si­bly for a mo­ment he mere­ly start­ed snor­ing.

The dor­mi­to­ry doors flew open, mak­ing them all jump: Ha­grid came strid­ing to­ward them, his hair rain­flecked, his bearskin coat flap­ping be­hind him, a cross­bow in his hand, leav­ing a trail of mud­dy dol­phin­sized foot­prints all over the floor.

“Bin in the for­est all day!” he pant­ed. “Ar­agog’s worse, I bin readin’ to him — didn’ get up ter din­ner till jus’ now an’ then Pro­fes­sor Sprout told me abou’ Ron! How is he?”

“Not bad,” said Har­ry. “They say he’ll be okay.”

“No more than six vis­itors at a time!” said Madam Pom­frey, hur­ry­ing out of her of­fice.

“Ha­grid makes six,” George point­ed out.

“Oh . . . yes. ..” said Madam Pom­frey, who seemed to have been count­ing Ha­grid as sev­er­al peo­ple due to his vast­ness. To cov­er her con­fu­sion, she hur­ried off to clear up his mud­dy foot prints with her wand.

“I don’ be­lieve this,” said Ha­grid hoarse­ly, shak­ing his great shag­gy head as he stared down at Ron. “Jus’ don’ be­lieve it… Look at him lyin’ there. . . . Who’d want ter hurt him, eh?”

“That’s just what we were dis­cussing,” said Har­ry. “We don’t know.”

“Some­one couldn’ have a grudge against the Gryfinndor Quid­ditch team, could they?” said Ha­grid anx­ious­ly. “Firs’ Katie, now Ron . . .”

“I cant see any­one try­ing to bump off a Quid­ditch team,” said

I m urge.

Wood might’ve done the Slytherins if he could’ve got away with it,” said Fred fair­ly.

Well, I don’t think it’s Quid­ditch, but I think there’s a con­nec­tion be­tween the at­tacks,” said Hermione qui­et­ly

“How d’you work that out?” asked Fred.

“Well, for one thing, they both ought to have been fa­tal and weren’t, al­though that was pure luck. And for an­oth­er, nei­ther the poi­son nor the neck­lace seems to have reached the per­son who was (sup­posed to be killed. Of course,” she added brood­ing­ly, “that makes the per­son be­hind this even more dan­ger­ous in a way, be­cause they don’t seem to care how many peo­ple they fin­ish off In lore they ac­tu­al­ly reach their vic­tim.”

Be­fore any­body could re­spond to this omi­nous pro­nounce­ment, tin- dor­mi­to­ry doors opened again and Mr. and Mrs. Weasley hur­ried up the ward. They had done no more than sat­is­fy them­selves that Ron would make a full re­cov­ery on their last vis­it to the ward; now Mrs. Weasley seized hold of Har­ry and hugged him very tighty. “Dum­ble­dore’s told us how you saved him with the be­zoar,” she sobbed. “Oh, Har­ry, what can we say? You saved Gin­ny . . . you saved Arthur , . . now you’ve saved Ron

“Don’t be … I didn’t. . .” mut­tered Har­ry awk­ward­ly. “Half our fam­ily does seem to owe you their lives, now I stop and think about it,” Mr. Weasley said in a con­strict­ed voice. “Well, all I can say is that it was a lucky clay for the Weasleys when Ron de­cid­ed to sit in your com­part­ment on the Hog­warts Ex­pirv., Har­ry.”

Har­ry could not think of any re­ply to this and was al­most gl.i«l when Madam Pom­frey re­mind­ed them that there were on­ly sup­posed to be six vis­itors around Ron’s bed; he and Hermione rose .h once to leave and Ha­grid de­cid­ed to go with them, leav­ing Ron with his fam­ily.

“It’s ter­ri­ble,” growled Ha­grid in­to his beard, as the three ol them walked back along the cor­ri­dor to the mar­ble stair­case. “Ml this new se­cu­ri­ty, an kids are still get­tin’ hurt. . . . Dum­ble­doiv’s wor­ried sick. . . . He don say much, but I can tell. . . .”

“Hasn’t he got any ideas, Ha­grid?” asked Hermione des­per­ate­ly.

“I spect he’s got hun­dreds of ideas, brain like his,” said Ha­grid. “But he doesn’ know who sent that neck­lace nor put poi­son in that wine, or they’dve bin caught, wouldn they? Wha’ wor­ries me,” said Ha­grid, low­er­ing his voice and glanc­ing over his shoul­der (Har­ry, for good mea­sure, checked the ceil­ing for Peeves), “is how long Hog­warts can stay open if kids are bein’ at­tacked. Cham­ber o’ Se­crets all over again, isn’ it? There’ll be pan­ic, more par­ents takin their kids out­ta school, an nex’ thing yeh know the board o’ gov­er­nors …”

Ha­grid stopped talk­ing as the ghost of a long­haired wom­an drift­ed serene­ly past, then re­sumed in a hoarse whis­per, “. . . the board o’ gov­er­nors’ll be talkin about shut­tin’ us up fer good.”

“Sure­ly not?” said Hermione, look­ing wor­ried.

“Got­ta see it from their point o’ view,” said Ha­grid heav­ily. “I mean, it’s al­ways bin a bit of a risk sendin a kid ter Hog­warts, hasn’ it? Yer ex­pect ac­ci­dents, don’ yeh, with hun­dreds of un­der­age wiz­ards all locked up ter­geth­er, but at­tempt­ed mur­der, tha’s tliff’rent. ‘S’no won­der Dum­ble­dore’s an­gry with Sn —”

Ha­grid stopped in his tracks, a fa­mil­iar, guilty ex­pres­sion on what was vis­ible of his face above his tan­gled black beard.

“What?” said Har­ry quick­ly. “Dum­ble­dore’s an­gry with Snape?”

“I nev­er said tha’,” said Ha­grid, though his look of pan­ic could not have been a big­ger give­away. “Look at the time, it’s get­tin’ on fer mid­night, I need ter —”

“Ha­grid, why is Dum­ble­dore an­gry with Snape?” Har­ry asked loud­ly.

“Shh­hh!” said Ha­grid, look­ing both ner­vous and an­gry. “Don’ shout stuff like that, Har­ry, d’yeh wan’ me ter lose me job? Mind, I don’ sup­pose yeh’d care, would yeh, not now yeh’ve giv­en up Care of Mag—”

“Don’t try and make me feel guilty, it wont work!” said Har­ry force­ful­ly. “What’s Snape done?”

“I dun­no, Har­ry, I shouldn’ta heard it at all! I — well, I was comin’ out­ta the for­est the oth­er evenin’ an’ I over­heard ‘em talk­ing— well, ar­guin’. Didn’t like ter draw at­ten­tion to me­self, so I sor­ta skulked an tried not ter lis­ten, but it was a — well, a heat­ed dis­cus­sion an’ it wasn’ easy ter block it out.”

“Well?” Har­ry urged him, as Ha­grid shuf­fled his enor­mous feet un­easi­ly.

“Well — I jus’ heard Snape sayin’ Dum­ble­dore took too much fer grant­ed an maybe he — Snape — didn’ wan’ ter do it any more —“

“Do what?”

“I dun­no, Har­ry, it sound­ed like Snape was feel­in’ a bit over­worked, tha’s all — any­way, Dum­ble­dore told him flat out he’d agreed ter do it an’ that was all there was to it. Pret­ty firm with him. An’ then he said sum­mat abou’ Snape makin’ in­ves­ti­ga­tions in his House, in Slytherin. Well, there’s noth­in’ strange abou’ that!” Ha­grid added hasti­ly, as Har­ry and Hermione ex­changed looks full of mean­ing. “All the Heads o’ Hous­es were asked ter look in­ter that neck­lace busi­ness —”

“Yeah, but Dum­ble­dore’s not hav­ing rows with the rest of them, is he?” said Har­ry.

“Look,” Ha­grid twist­ed his cross­bow un­com­fort­ably in his hands; there was a loud splin­ter­ing sound and it snapped in two. “I know what yeh’re like abou’ Snape, Har­ry, an’ I don’ want yeh ter go readin’ more in­ter this than there is.”

“Look out,” said Hermione terse­ly.

They turned just in time to see the shad­ow of Ar­gus Filch loom­ing over the wall be­hind them be­fore the man him­self turned the cor­ner, hunch­backed, his jowls aquiver.

“Oho!” he wheezed. “Out of bed so late, this’ll mean de­ten­tion!”

“No it won’, Filch,” said Ha­grid short­ly. “They’re with me, aren’ they?”

“And what dif­fer­ence does that make?” asked Filch ob­nox­ious­ly.

“I’m a rud­dy teach­er, aren’ I, yeh sneakin’ Squib!” said Ha­grid, fir­ing up at once.

There was a nasty hiss­ing noise as Filch swelled with fury; Mrs. Nor­ris had ar­rived, un­seen, and was twist­ing her­self sin­uous­ly around Filch’s skin­ny an­kles.

“Get goin,” said Ha­grid out of the cor­ner of his mouth.

Har­ry did not need telling twice; he and Hermione both hur­ried off; Ha­grid’s and Filch’s raised voic­es echoed be­hind them as they ran. They passed Peeves near the turn­ing in­to Gryffind­or Tow­er, but he was streak­ing hap­pi­ly to­ward the source of the yelling, cack­ling and call­ing,

When there’s strife and when there’s trou­ble

Call on Peevsie, he’ll make dou­ble!

The Fat La­dy was snooz­ing and not pleased to be wo­ken, but swung for­ward grumpi­ly to al­low them to clam­ber in­to the mer­ci­ful­ly peace­ful and emp­ty com­mon room. It did not seem that peo­ple knew about Ron yet; Har­ry was very re­lieved: He had been in­ter­ro­gat­ed enough that day. Hermione bade him good night and set off for the girls’ dor­mi­to­ry. Har­ry, how­ev­er, re­mained be­hind, tak­ing a seat be­side the fire and look­ing down in­to the dy­ing em­bers.

So Dum­ble­dore had ar­gued with Snape. In spite of all he had told Har­ry, in spite of his in­sis­tence that he trust­ed Snape com­plete­ly, he had lost his tem­per with him. . . . He did not think that Snape had tried hard enough to in­ves­ti­gate the Slytherins … or, per­haps, to in­ves­ti­gate a sin­gle Slytherin: Mal­foy?

Was it be­cause Dum­ble­dore did not want Har­ry to do any­thing fool­ish, to take mat­ters in­to his own hands, that he had pre­tend­ed there was noth­ing in Har­ry’s sus­pi­cions? That seemed like­ly. It , might even be that Dum­ble­dore did not want any­thing to dis­tract Har­ry from their lessons, or from procur­ing that mem­ory from Slughorn. Per­haps Dum­ble­dore did not think it right to con­fide sus­pi­cions about his staff to six­teenyearolds. …

“There you are, Pot­ter!”

Har­ry jumped to his feet in shock, his wand at the ready. He had been quite con­vinced that the com­mon room was emp­ty; he had not been at all pre­pared for a hulk­ing fig­ure to rise sud­den­ly out of a dis­tant chair. A clos­er look showed him that it was Cor­mac McLaggen.

“I’ve been wait­ing for you to come back,” said McLaggen, dis­re­gard­ing Har­ry’s drawn wand. “Must’ve fall­en asleep. Look, I saw them tak­ing Weasley up to the hos­pi­tal wing ear­li­er. Didn’t look like he’ll be fit for next week’s match.”

It took Har­ry a few mo­ments to re­al­ize what McLaggen was talk­ing about.

“Oh . . . right. . . Quid­ditch,” he said, putting his wand back in­to the belt of his jeans and run­ning a hand weari­ly through his hair. “Yeah … he might not make it.”

“Well, then, I’ll be play­ing Keep­er, won’t I?” said McLaggen.

“Yeah,” said Har­ry. “Yeah, I sup­pose so. …”

He could not think of an ar­gu­ment against it; af­ter all, McLaggen had cer­tain­ly per­formed sec­ondbest in the tri­als.

“Ex­cel­lent,” said McLaggen in a sat­is­fied voice. “So when’s prac­tice?”

“What? Oh . . . there’s one to­mor­row evening.”

“Good. Lis­ten, Pot­ter, we should have a talk be­fore­hand. I’ve got some ideas on strat­egy you might find use­ful.”

“Right,” said Har­ry un­en­thu­si­as­ti­cal­ly. “Well, I’ll hear them to­mor­row, then. I’m pret­ty tired now … see you . . .”

The news that Ron had been poi­soned spread quick­ly next day, but it did not cause the sen­sa­tion that Katie’s at­tack had done. Peo­ple seemed to think that it might have been an ac­ci­dent, giv­en that he had been in the Po­tions mas­ter’s room at the time, and that as he had been giv­en an an­ti­dote im­me­di­ate­ly there was no re­al harm done. In fact, the Gryffind­ors were gen­er­al­ly much more in­ter­est­ed in the up­com­ing Quid­ditch match against Huf­flepuff, for many of them want­ed to see Zacharias Smith, who played Chas­er on the Huf­flepuff team, pun­ished sound­ly for his com­men­tary dur­ing the open­ing match against Slytherin.

Har­ry, how­ev­er, had nev­er been less in­ter­est­ed in Quid­ditch; he was rapid­ly be­com­ing ob­sessed with Dra­co Mal­foy. Still check­ing the Ma­raud­er’s Map when­ev­er he got a chance, he some­times made de­tours to wher­ev­er Mal­foy hap­pened to be, but had not yet de­tect­ed him do­ing any­thing out of the or­di­nary. And still there were those in­ex­pli­ca­ble times when Mal­foy sim­ply van­ished from the map. . . .

But Har­ry did not get a lot of time to con­sid­er the prob­lem, what with Quid­ditch prac­tice, home­work, and the fact that he was now be­ing dogged wher­ev­er he went by Cor­mac McLaggen and Laven­der Brown.

He could not de­cide which of them was more an­noy­ing. McLaggen kept up a con­stant stream of hints that he would make a bet­ter per­ma­nent Keep­er for the team than Ron, and that now that Har­ry was see­ing him play reg­ular­ly he would sure­ly come around to this way of think­ing too; he was al­so keen to crit­icize the oth­er play­ers and pro­vide Har­ry with de­tailed train­ing schemes, so that more than once Har­ry was forced to re­mind him who was Cap­tain.

Mean­while, Laven­der kept sidling up to Har­ry to dis­cuss Ron, which Har­ry found al­most more wear­ing than McLaggen’s Quid­ditch lec­tures. At first, Laven­der had been very an­noyed that no­body had thought to tell her that Ron was in the hos­pi­tal wing — “I mean, I am his girl­friend!” — but un­for­tu­nate­ly slith­ad now de­cid­ed to for­give Har­ry this lapse of mem­ory and was keen to have lots of in­depth chats with him about Ron’s feel­in­gs, a most un­com­fort­able ex­pe­ri­ence that Har­ry would have hap­pi­ly for­gone.

“Look, why don’t you talk to Ron about all this?” Har­ry asked, af­ter a par­tic­ular­ly long in­ter­ro­ga­tion from Laven­der that took in ev­ery­thing from pre­cise­ly what Ron had said about her new drew robes to whether or not Har­ry thought that Ron con­sid­ered his re­la­tion­ship with Laven­der to be “se­ri­ous.”

“Well, I would, but he’s al­ways asleep when I go and see him!” said Laven­der fret­ful­ly.

“Is he?” said Har­ry, sur­prised, for he had found Ron per­fect­ly alert ev­ery time he had been up to the hos­pi­tal wing, both high­ly in­ter­est­ed in the news of Dum­ble­dore and Snape’s row and keen m abuse McLaggen as much as pos­si­ble.

“Is Hermione Granger still vis­it­ing him?” Laven­der de­mand­ed sud­den­ly.

“Yeah, I think so. Well, they’re friends, aren’t they?” said Har­ry un­com­fort­ably.

“Friends, don’t make me laugh,” said Laven­der scorn­ful­ly. “She didn’t talk to him for weeks af­ter he start­ed go­ing out with me! But I sup­pose she wants to make up with him now he’s all in­ter­est­ing. …”

“Would you call get­ting poi­soned be­ing in­ter­est­ing?” asked Har­ry. “Any­way — sor­ry, got to go — there’s McLaggen com­ing for a talk about Quid­ditch,” said Har­ry hur­ried­ly, and he dashed side­ways through a door pre­tend­ing to be sol­id wall and sprint­ed down the short­cut that would take him off to Po­tions where, thank­ful­ly, nei­ther Laven­der nor McLaggen could fol­low him.

On the morn­ing of the Quid­ditch match against Huf­flepuff, Har­ry dropped in on the hos­pi­tal wing be­fore head­ing down to the pitch. Ron was very ag­itat­ed; Madam Pom­frey would not let him go down to watch the match, feel­ing it would overex­cite him.

“So how’s McLaggen shap­ing up?” he asked Har­ry ner­vous­ly, ap­par­ent­ly for­get­ting that he had al­ready asked the same ques­tion twice.

“I’ve told you,” said Har­ry pa­tient­ly, “he could be world­class and I wouldn’t want to keep him. He keeps try­ing to tell ev­ery­one what to do, he thinks he could play ev­ery po­si­tion bet­ter than the rest of us. I can’t wait to be shot of him. And speak­ing of get­ting shot of peo­ple,” Har­ry added, get­ting to his feet and pick­ing up his Fire­bolt, “will you stop pre­tend­ing to be asleep when Laven­der comes to see you? She’s driv­ing me mad as well.”

“Oh,” said Ron, look­ing sheep­ish. “Yeah. All right.”

“If you don’t want to go out with her any­more, just tell her,” said Har­ry.

“Yeah . . . well. . . it’s not that easy, is it?” said Ron. He paused. “Hermione go­ing to look in be­fore the match?” he added ca­su­al­ly.

“No, she’s al­ready gone down to the pitch with Gin­ny.”

“Oh,” said Ron, look­ing rather glum. “Right. Well, good luck. Hope you ham­mer McLag — I mean, Smith.”

“I’ll try,” said Har­ry, shoul­der­ing his broom. “See you af­ter the match.”

He hur­ried down through the de­sert­ed cor­ri­dors; the whole school was out­side, ei­ther al­ready seat­ed in the sta­di­um or head­ing down to­ward it. He was look­ing out of the win­dows he passed, try­ing to gauge how much wind they were fac­ing, when a noise ahead made him glance up and he saw Mal­foy walk­ing to­ward him, ac­com­pa­nied by two girls, both of whom looked sulky and re­sent­ful.

Mal­foy stopped short at the sight of Har­ry, then gave a short, hu­mor­less laugh and con­tin­ued walk­ing.

“Where’re you go­ing?” Har­ry de­mand­ed.

“Yeah, I’m re­al­ly go­ing to tell you, be­cause it’s your busi­ness, Pot­ter,” sneered Mal­foy. “You’d bet­ter hur­ry up, they’ll be wait­ing for ‘the Cho­sen Cap­tain’ — ‘the Boy Who Scored’ — what­ev­er they call you these days.”

One of the girls gave an un­will­ing gig­gle. Har­ry stared at her. She blushed. Mal­foy pushed past Har­ry and she and her friend fol­lowed at a trot, turn­ing the cor­ner and van­ish­ing from view.

Har­ry stood root­ed on the spot and watched them dis­ap­pear. This was in­fu­ri­at­ing; he was al­ready cut­ting it fine to get to the match on time and yet there was Mal­foy, skulk­ing off while the rest of the school was ab­sent: Har­ry’s best chance yet of dis­cov­er­ing what Mal­foy was up to. The silent sec­onds trick­led past, and Har­ry re­mained where he was, frozen, gaz­ing at the place where Mal­foy had van­ished. . . .

“Where have you been?” de­mand­ed Gin­ny, as Har­ry sprint­ed in­to the chang­ing rooms. The whole team was changed and ready; Coote and Peakes, the Beat­ers, were both hit­ting their clubs ner­vous­ly against their legs.

“I met Mal­foy,” Har­ry told her qui­et­ly, as he pulled his scar­let robes over his head.

“So I want­ed to know how come he’s up at the cas­tle with a cou­ple of girl­friends while ev­ery­one else is down here. …”

“Does it mat­ter right now?”

“Well, I’m not like­ly to find out, am I?” said Har­ry, seiz­ing his Fire­bolt and push­ing his glass­es straight. “Come on then!”

And with­out an­oth­er word, he marched out on­to the pitch to deaf­en­ing cheers and boos.

There was lit­tle wind; the clouds were patchy; ev­ery now and then there were daz­zling flash­es of bright sun­light.

“Tricky con­di­tions!” McLaggen said brac­ing­ly to the team. “Coote, Peakes, you’ll want to fly out of the sun, so they don’t see you com­ing —”

“I’m the Cap­tain, McLaggen, shut up giv­ing them in­struc­tions,” said Har­ry an­gri­ly. “Just get up by the goal posts!”

Once McLaggen had marched off, Har­ry turned to Coote and Peakes.

“Make sure you do fly out of the sun,” he told them grudg­ing­ly.

He shook hands with the Huf­flepuff Cap­tain, and then, on Madam Hooch’s whis­tle, kicked off and rose in­to the air, high­er than the rest of his team, streak­ing around the pitch in search of the Snitch. If he could catch it good and ear­ly, there might be a chance he could get back up to the cas­tle, seize the Ma­raud­er’s Map, and find out what Mal­foy was do­ing. . . .

“And that’s Smith of Huf­flepuff with the Quaf­fle,” said a dreamy voice, echo­ing over the grounds. “He did the com­men­tary last time, of course, and Gin­ny Weasley flew in­to him, I think prob­ably on pur­pose, it looked like it. Smith was be­ing quite rude about Gryffind­or, I ex­pect he re­grets that now he’s play­ing them — oh, look, he’s lost the Quaf­fle, Gin­ny took it from him, I do like her, she’s very nice. …”

Har­ry stared down at the com­men­ta­tor’s po­di­um. Sure­ly no­body in their right mind would have let Lu­na Love­good com­men­tate? But even from above there was no mis­tak­ing that long, dirty­blonde hair, nor the neck­lace of but­ter­beer corks. . . . Be­side Lu­na, Pro­fes­sor McG­ona­gall was look­ing slight­ly un­com­fort­able, as though she was in­deed hav­ing sec­ond thoughts about this ap­point­ment.

“. . . but now that big Huf­flepuff play­er’s got the Quaf­fle from , her, I can’t re­mem­ber his name, it’s some­thing like Bib­ble — no, Bug­gins —”

“It’s Cad­wal­lad­er!” said Pro­fes­sor McG­ona­gall loud­ly from be­side Lu­na. The crowd laughed.

Har­ry stared around for the Snitch; there was no sign of it. Mo­ments lat­er, Cad­wal­lad­er scored. McLaggen had been shout­ing crit­icism at Gin­ny for al­low­ing the Quaf­fle out of her pos­ses­sion, with the re­sult that he had not no­ticed the large red ball soar­ing past his right ear.

“McLaggen, will you pay at­ten­tion to what you’re sup­posed to be do­ing and leave ev­ery­one else alone!” bel­lowed Har­ry, wheel­ing around to face his Keep­er.

“You’re not set­ting a great ex­am­ple!” McLaggen shout­ed back, red­faced and fu­ri­ous.

“And Har­ry Pot­ter’s now hav­ing an ar­gu­ment with his Keep­er,” said Lu­na serene­ly, while both Huf­flepuffs and Slytherins be­low in the crowd cheered and jeered. “I don’t think that’ll help him find the Snitch, but maybe it’s a clever ruse. …”

Swear­ing an­gri­ly, Har­ry spun round and set off around the pitch again, scan­ning the skies for some sign of the tiny, winged gold­en ball.

Gin­ny and Demelza scored a goal apiece, giv­ing the redand­gold­clad sup­port­ers be­low some­thing to cheer about. Then Cad­wal­lad­er scored again, mak­ing things lev­el, but Lu­na did not seem to have no­ticed; she ap­peared sin­gu­lar­ly un­in­ter­est­ed in such mun­dane things as the score, and kept at­tempt­ing to draw the crowd’s at­ten­tion to such things as in­ter­est­ing­ly shaped clouds and the pos­si­bil­ity that Zacharias Smith, who had so far failed to main­tain pos­ses­sion of the Quaf­fle for longer than a minute, was suf­fer­ing from some­thing called “Los­er’s Lur­gy.”

“Sev­en­ty­forty to Huf­flepuff!” barked Pro­fes­sor McG­ona­gall in­to Lu­na’s mega­phone.

“Is it, al­ready?” said Lu­na vague­ly. “Oh, look! The Gryffind­or Keep­er’s got hold of one of the Beat­er’s bats.”

Har­ry spun around in midair. Sure enough, McLaggen, for rea­sons best known to him­self, had pulled Peakes’s bat from him and ap­peared to be de­mon­strat­ing how to hit a Bludger to­ward an on­com­ing Cad­wal­lad­er.

“Will you give him back his bat and get back to the goal posts!” roared Har­ry, pelt­ing to­ward McLaggen just as McLaggen took a fe­ro­cious swipe at the Bludger and mishit it.

A blind­ing, sick­en­ing pain … a flash of light. . . dis­tant screams . . . and the sen­sa­tion of falling down a long tun­nel. . .

And the next thing Har­ry knew, he was ly­ing in a re­mark­ably warm and com­fort­able bed and look­ing up at a lamp that was throw­ing a cir­cle of gold­en light on­to a shad­owy ceil­ing. He raised his head awk­ward­ly. There on his left was a fa­mil­iar­look­ing, freck­ly, red­haired per­son.

“Nice of you to drop in,” said Ron, grin­ning.

Har­ry blinked and looked around. Of course: He was in the hos­pi­tal wing. The sky out­side was in­di­go streaked with crim­son. The match must have fin­ished hours ago … as had any hope of cor­ner­ing Mal­foy. Har­ry’s head felt strange­ly heavy; he raised a hand and felt a stiff tur­ban of ban­dages.

“What hap­pened?”

“Cracked skull,” said Madam Pom­frey, bustling up and push­ing him back against his pil­lows. “Noth­ing to wor­ry about, I mend­ed it at once, but I’m keep­ing you in overnight. You shouldn’t over ex­ert your­self for a few hours.”

“I don’t want to stay here overnight,” said Har­ry an­gri­ly, sit­ting up and throw­ing back his cov­ers. “I want to find McLaggen and kill him.”

“I’m afraid that would come un­der the head­ing of ‘overex­er­tion,’” said Madam Pom­frey, push­ing him firm­ly back on­to the bed and rais­ing her wand in a threat­en­ing man­ner. “You will stay here un­til I dis­charge you, Pot­ter, or I shall call the head­mas­ter.”

She bus­tled back in­to her of­fice, and Har­ry sank back in­to his pil­lows, fum­ing.

“D’you know how much we lost by?” he asked Ron through clenched teeth.

“Well, yeah I do,” said Ron apo­lo­get­ical­ly. “Fi­nal score was three hun­dred and twen­ty to six­ty.”

“Bril­liant,” said Har­ry sav­age­ly. “Re­al­ly bril­liant! When I get hold of McLaggen —”

“You don’t want to get hold of him, he’s the size of a troll,” said

Ron rea­son­ably. “Per­son­al­ly, I think there’s a lot to be said for hex­ing him with that toe­nail thing of the Prince’s. Any­way, the rest of the team might’ve dealt with him be­fore you get out of here, they’re not hap­py. …”

There was a note of bad­ly sup­pressed glee in Rons voice; Har­ry could tell he was noth­ing short of thrilled that McLaggen had messed up so bad­ly. Har­ry lay there, star­ing up at the patch of light on the ceil­ing, his re­cent­ly mend­ed skull not hurt­ing, pre­cise­ly, but feel­ing slight­ly ten­der un­der­neath all the ban­dag­ing.

“I could hear the match com­men­tary from here,” said Ron, his voice now shak­ing with laugh­ter. “I hope Lu­na al­ways com­men­tates from now on. . . . Los­er’s Lur­gy …”

But Har­ry was still too an­gry to see much hu­mor in the sit­ua­tion, and af­ter a while Ron’s snorts sub­sid­ed.

“Gin­ny came in to vis­it while you were un­con­scious,” he said, af­ter a long pause, and Har­ry’s imag­ina­tion zoomed in­to over­drive, rapid­ly con­struct­ing a scene in which Gin­ny, weep­ing over his life­less form, con­fessed her feel­in­gs of deep at­trac­tion to him while Ron gave them his bless­ing. . . .”She reck­ons you on­ly just ar­rived on time for the match. How come? You left here ear­ly enough.”

“Oh . . .” said Har­ry, as the scene in his mind’s eye im­plod­ed. “Yeah . . . well, I saw Mal­foy sneak­ing off with a cou­ple of girls who didn’t look like they want­ed to be with him, and that’s the sec­ond time he’s made sure he isn’t down on the Quid­ditch pitch with the rest of the school; he skipped the last match too, re­mem­ber?” Har­ry sighed. “Wish I’d fol­lowed him now, the match was such a fi­as­co. . . .”

“Don’t be stupid,” said Ron sharply. “You couldn’t have missed a Quid­ditch match just to fol­low Mal­foy, you’re the Cap­tain!”

“I want to know what he’s up to,” said Har­ry. “And don’t tell nn its all in my head, not af­ter what I over­heard be­tween him and Snape —”

“I nev­er said it was all in your head,” said Ron, hoist­ing him­self up on an el­bow in turn and frown­ing at Har­ry, “but there’s no rule say­ing on­ly one per­son at a time can be plot­ting any­thing in this place! You’re get­ting a bit ob­sessed with Mal­foy, Har­ry. I mean, think­ing about miss­ing a match just to fol­low him …”

“I want to catch him at it!” said Har­ry in frus­tra­tion. “I mean, where’s he go­ing when he dis­ap­pears off the map?”

“I dun­no . . . Hogsmeade?” sug­gest­ed Ron, yawn­ing.

“I’ve nev­er seen him go­ing along any of the se­cret pas­sage­way on the map. I thought they were be­ing watched now any­way?”

“Well then, I dun­no,” said Ron.

Si­lence fell be­tween them. Har­ry stared up at the cir­cle of lamp light above him, think­ing. . . .

If on­ly he had Ru­fus Scrim­geour’s pow­er, he would have been able to set a tail up­on Mal­foy, but un­for­tu­nate­ly Har­ry did not have an of­fice full of Au­rors at his com­mand. . . . He thought fleet­ing­ly of try­ing to set some­thing up with the D.A., but there again was the prob­lem that peo­ple would be missed from lessons; most of them, af­ter all, still had full sched­ules. . . .

There was a low, rum­bling snore from Ron’s bed. Af­ter a while Madam Pom­frey came out of her of­fice, this time wear­ing a thick dress­ing gown. It was eas­iest to feign sleep; Har­ry rolled over on­to his side and lis­tened to all the cur­tains clos­ing them­selves as she waved her wand. The lamps dimmed, and she re­turned to her of­fice; he heard the door click be­hind her and knew that she was off to bed.

This was, Har­ry re­flect­ed in the dark­ness, the third time that he had been brought to the hos­pi­tal wing be­cause of a Quid­ditch in­ju­ry. Last time he had fall­en off his broom due to the pres­ence of de­men­tors around the pitch, and the time be­fore that, all the bones had been re­moved from his arm by the in­cur­ably in­ept Pro­fes­sor Lock­hart. . . . That had been his most painful in­ju­ry by far … he re­mem­bered the agony of re­grow­ing an arm­ful of bones in one night, a dis­com­fort not eased by the ar­ri­val of an un­ex­pect­ed vis­itor in the mid­dle of the —

Har­ry sat bolt up­right, his heart pound­ing, his ban­dage tur­ban askew. He had the so­lu­tion at last: There was a way to have Mal­foy fol­lowed — how could he have for­got­ten, why hadn’t he thought

of it be­fore?

But the ques­tion was, how to call him? What did you do? Qui­et­ly, ten­ta­tive­ly, Har­ry spoke in­to the dark­ness.

“Kreach­er?”

There was a very loud crack, and the sounds of scuf­fling and squeaks filled the silent room. Ron awoke with a yelp.

“What’s go­ing — ?”

Har­ry point­ed his wand hasti­ly at the door of Madam Pom­frey’s of­fice and mut­tered, “Muf­flia­to!” so that she would not come run­ning. Then he scram­bled to the end of his bed for a bet­ter look at

what was go­ing on.

Two house­elves were rolling around on the floor in the mid­dle of the dor­mi­to­ry, one wear­ing a shrunk­en ma­roon jumper and sev­er­al wool­ly hats, the oth­er, a filthy old rag strung over his hips like a loin­cloth. Then there was an­oth­er loud bang, and Peeves the Poltergeist ap­peared in midair above the wrestling elves.

“I was watch­ing that, Pot­ty!” he told Har­ry in­dig­nant­ly, point­ing at the fight be­low, be­fore let­ting out a loud cack­le. “Look at the ick­le crea­tures squab­bling, bitey bitey, punchy punchy —”

“Kreach­er will not in­sult Har­ry Pot­ter in front of Dob­by, no he won’t, or Dob­by will shut Kreach­er’s mouth for him!” cried Dob­by in a high­pitched voice.

“— kicky, scratchy!” cried Peeves hap­pi­ly, now pelt­ing bits of’ chalk at the elves to en­rage them fur­ther. “Tweaky, pokey!”

“Kreach­er will say what he likes about his mas­ter, oh yes, and what a mas­ter he is, filthy friend of Mud­bloods, oh, what would poor Kreach­er’s mis­tress say — ?”

Ex­act­ly what Kreach­er’s mis­tress would have said they did not find out, for at that mo­ment Dob­by sank his knob­bly lit­tle fist in­to Kreach­er’s mouth and knocked out half of his teeth. Har­ry and Ron both leapt out of their beds and wrenched the two elves apart, though they con­tin­ued to try and kick and punch each oth­er, egged on by Peeves, who swooped around the lamp squeal­ing, “Stick your fin­gers up his nosey, draw his cork and pull his ear­sies —”

Har­ry aimed his wand at Peeves and said, “Lan­glock!” Peeves clutched at his throat, gulped, then swooped from the room mak­ing ob­scene ges­tures but un­able to speak, ow­ing to the fact that his tongue had just glued it­self to the roof of his mouth.

“Nice one,” said Ron ap­pre­cia­tive­ly, lift­ing Dob­by in­to the air so that his flail­ing limbs no longer made con­tact with Kreach­er. “That was an­oth­er Prince hex, wasn’t it?”

“Yeah,” said Har­ry, twist­ing Kreach­er’s wiz­ened arm in­to a half nel­son. “Right — I’m for­bid­ding you to fight each oth­er! Well, Kreach­er, you’re for­bid­den to fight Dob­by. Dob­by, I know I’m not al­lowed to give you or­ders —”

“Dob­by is a free house­elf and he can obey any­one he likes and Dob­by will do what­ev­er Har­ry Pot­ter wants him to do!” said Dob­by, tears now stream­ing down his shriv­eled lit­tle face on­to his jumper.

“Okay then,” said Har­ry, and he and Ron both re­leased the elves, who fell to the floor but did not con­tin­ue fight­ing.

“Mas­ter called me?” croaked Kreach­er, sink­ing in­to a bow even as he gave Har­ry a look that plain­ly wished him a painful death.

“Yeah, I did,” said Har­ry, glanc­ing to­ward Madam Pom­frey’s of­fice door to check that the Muf­flia­to spell was still work­ing; there was no sign that she had heard any of the com­mo­tion. “I’ve got a job for you.”

“Kreach­er will do what­ev­er Mas­ter wants,” said Kreach­er, sink­ing so low that his lips al­most touched his gnarled toes, “be­cause Kreach­er has no choice, but Kreach­er is ashamed to have such a mas­ter, yes —”

“Dob­by will do it, Har­ry Pot­ter!” squeaked Dob­by, his ten­nis­ball­sized eyes still swim­ming in tears. “Dob­by would be hon­ored to help Har­ry Pot­ter!”

“Come to think of it, it would be good to have both of you,” said Har­ry. “Okay then … I want you to tail Dra­co Mal­foy.”

Ig­nor­ing the look of min­gled sur­prise and ex­as­per­ation on Ron’s face, Har­ry went on, “I want to know where he’s go­ing, who he’s meet­ing, and what he’s do­ing. I want you to fol­low him around the clock.”

“Yes, Har­ry Pot­ter!” said Dob­by at once, his great eyes shin­ing with ex­cite­ment. “And if Dob­by does it wrong, Dob­by will throw him­self off the top­most tow­er, Har­ry Pot­ter!”

“There won’t be any need for that,” said Har­ry hasti­ly.

“Mas­ter wants me to fol­low the youngest of the Mal­foys?” croaked Kreach­er. “Mas­ter wants me to spy up­on the pure­blood great­nephew of my old mis­tress?”

“That’s the one,” said Har­ry, fore­see­ing a great dan­ger and de­ter­min­ing to pre­vent it im­me­di­ate­ly. “And you’re for­bid­den to tip him off, Kreach­er, or to show him what you’re up to, or to talk to him at all, or to write him mes­sages or … or to con­tact him in any way. Got it?”

He thought he could see Kreach­er strug­gling to see a loop­hole in the in­struc­tions he had just been giv­en and wait­ed. Af­ter a mo­ment or two, and to Har­rys great sat­is­fac­tion, Kreach­er bowed deeply again and said, with bit­ter re­sent­ment, “Mas­ter thinks of ev­ery­thing, and Kreach­er must obey him even though Kreach­er would much rather be the ser­vant of the Mal­foy boy, oh yes. . . .”

“That’s set­tled, then,” said Har­ry. “I’ll want reg­ular re­ports, but make sure I’m not sur­round­ed by peo­ple when you turn up. Ron and Hermione are okay. And don’t tell any­one what you’re do­ing. Just stick to Mal­foy like a cou­ple of wart plas­ters.”
