Chapter 1: The Other Minister


It was near­ing mid­night and the Prime Min­is­ter was sit­ting alone in his of­fice, read­ing a long memo that was slip­ping through his brain with­out leav­ing the slight­est trace of mean­ing be­hind. He was wait­ing for a call from the Pres­ident of a far dis­tant coun­try, and be­tween won­der­ing when the wretched man would tele­phone, and try­ing to sup­press un­pleas­ant mem­ories of what had been a very long, tir­ing, and dif­fi­cult week, there was not much space in his head for any­thing else. The more he at­tempt­ed to fo­cus on the print on the page be­fore him, the more clear­ly the Prime Min­is­ter could see the gloat­ing face of one of his po­lit­ical op­po­nents. This par­tic­ular op­po­nent had ap­peared on the news that very day, not on­ly to enu­mer­ate all the ter­ri­ble things that had hap­pened in the last week (as though any­one need­ed re­mind­ing) but al­so to ex­plain why each and ev­ery one of them was the gov­ern­ment’s fault.

The Prime Min­is­ter’s pulse quick­ened at the very thought of these ac­cu­sa­tions, for they were nei­ther fair nor true. How on earth was his gov­ern­ment sup­posed to have stopped that bridge col­laps­ing? It was out­ra­geous for any­body to sug­gest that they were not spend­ing enough on bridges. The bridge was few­er than ten years old, and the best ex­perts were at a loss to ex­plain why it had snapped clean­ly in two, send­ing a dozen cars in­to the wa­tery depths of the riv­er be­low. And how dare any­one sug­gest that it was lack of po­lice­men that had re­sult­ed in those two very nasty and wellpub­li­cized mur­ders? Or that the gov­ern­ment should have some­how fore­seen the freak hur­ri­cane in the West Coun­try that had caused so much dam­age to both peo­ple and prop­er­ty? And was it his fault that one of his Ju­nior Min­is­ters, Her­bert Chor­ley, had cho­sen this week to act so pe­cu­liar­ly that he was now go­ing to be spend­ing a lot more time with his fam­ily?

“A grim mood has gripped the coun­try,” the op­po­nent had con­clud­ed, bare­ly con­ceal­ing his own broad grin.

And un­for­tu­nate­ly, this was per­fect­ly true. The Prime Min­is­ter felt it him­self; peo­ple re­al­ly did seem more mis­er­able than usu­al. Even the weath­er was dis­mal; all this chilly mist in the mid­dle of Ju­ly… It wasn’t right, it wasn’t nor­mal…

He turned over the sec­ond page of the memo, saw how much longer it went on, and gave it up as a bad job. Stretch­ing his arms above his head he looked around his of­fice mourn­ful­ly. It was a hand­some room, with a fine mar­ble fire­place fac­ing the long sash win­dows, firm­ly closed against the un­sea­son­able chill. With a slight shiv­er, the Prime Min­is­ter got up and moved over to the win­dow, look­ing out at the thin mist that was press­ing it­self against the glass. It was then, as he stood with his back to the room, that he heard a soft cough be­hind him.

He froze, nose to nose with his own scared­look­ing re­flec­tion in the dark glass. He knew that cough. He had heard it be­fore. He turned very slow­ly to face the emp­ty room.

“Hel­lo?” he said, try­ing to sound braver than he felt.

For a brief mo­ment he al­lowed him­self the im­pos­si­ble hope that no­body would an­swer him. How­ev­er, a voice re­spond­ed at once, a crisp, de­ci­sive voice that sound­ed as though it were read­ing a pre­pared state­ment. It was com­ing — as the Prime Min­is­ter had known at the first cough — from the frog­like lit­tle man wear­ing a long sil­ver wig who was de­pict­ed in a small, dirty oil paint­ing in the far cor­ner of the room.

“To the Prime Min­is­ter of Mug­gles. Ur­gent we meet. Kind­ly re­spond im­me­di­ate­ly. Sin­cere­ly, Fudge.”

The man in the paint­ing looked in­quir­ing­ly at the Prime Min­is­ter.

“Er,” said the Prime Min­is­ter, “lis­ten… It’s not a very good time for me… I’m wait­ing for a tele­phone call, you see… from the Pres­ident of–“

“That can be re­ar­ranged,” said the por­trait at once. The Prime Min­is­ter’s heart sank. He had been afraid of that.

“But I re­al­ly was rather hop­ing to speak–“

“We shall ar­range for the Pres­ident to for­get to call. He will tele­phone to­mor­row night in­stead,” said the lit­tle man. “Kind­ly re­spond im­me­di­ate­ly to Mr. Fudge.”

“I… oh… very well,” said the Prime Min­is­ter weak­ly. “Yes, I’ll see Fudge.”

He hur­ried back to his desk, straight­en­ing his tie as he went. He had bare­ly re­sumed his seat, and ar­ranged his face in­to what he hoped was a re­laxed and un­fazed ex­pres­sion, when bright green flames burst in­to life in the emp­ty grate be­neath his mar­ble man­tel­piece. He watched, try­ing not to be­tray a flick­er of sur­prise or alarm, as a port­ly man ap­peared with­in the flames, spin­ning as fast as a top. Sec­onds lat­er, he had climbed out on­to a rather fine an­tique rug, brush­ing ash from the sleeves of his long pin­striped cloak, a limegreen bowler hat in his hand.

“Ah… Prime Min­is­ter,” said Cor­nelius Fudge, strid­ing for­ward with his hand out­stretched. “Good to see you again.”

The Prime Min­is­ter could not hon­est­ly re­turn this com­pli­ment, so said noth­ing at all. He was not re­mote­ly pleased to see Fudge, whose oc­ca­sion­al ap­pear­an­ces, apart from be­ing down­right alarm­ing in them­selves, gen­er­al­ly meant that he was about to hear some very bad news. Fur­ther­more, Fudge was look­ing dis­tinct­ly care­worn. He was thin­ner, balder, and gray­er, and his face had a crum­pled look. The Prime Min­is­ter had seen that kind of look in poli­ti­cians be­fore, and it nev­er bod­ed well.

“How can I help you?” he said, shak­ing Fudge’s hand very briefly and ges­tur­ing to­ward the hard­est of the chairs in front of the desk.

“Dif­fi­cult to know where to be­gin,” mut­tered Fudge, pulling up the chair, sit­ting down, and plac­ing his green bowler up­on his knees. “What a week, what a week…”

“Had a bad one too, have you?” asked the Prime Min­is­ter stiffly, hop­ing to con­vey by this that he had quite enough on his plate al­ready with­out any ex­tra help­in­gs from Fudge.

“Yes, of course,” said Fudge, rub­bing his eyes weari­ly and look­ing mo­rose­ly at the Prime Min­is­ter. “I’ve been hav­ing the same week you have, Prime Min­is­ter. The Brock­dale Bridge… the Bones and Vance mur­ders… not to men­tion the ruckus in the West Coun­try…”

“You–er–your–I mean to say, some of your peo­ple were–were in­volved in those–those things, were they?”

Fudge fixed the Prime Min­is­ter with a rather stern look. “Of course they were,” he said, “Sure­ly you’ve re­al­ized what’s go­ing on?”

“I…” hes­itat­ed the Prime Min­is­ter.

It was pre­cise­ly this sort of be­hav­ior that made him dis­like Fudge’s vis­its so much. He was, af­ter all, the Prime Min­is­ter and did not ap­pre­ci­ate be­ing made to feel like an ig­no­rant school­boy. But of course, it had been like this from his very first meet­ing with Fudge on his very first evening as Prime Min­is­ter. He re­mem­bered it as though it were yes­ter­day and knew it would haunt him un­til his dy­ing day.

He had been stand­ing alone in this very of­fice, sa­vor­ing the tri­umph that was his af­ter so many years of dream­ing and schem­ing, when he had heard a cough be­hind him, just like tonight, and turned to find that ug­ly lit­tle por­trait talk­ing to him, an­nounc­ing that the Min­is­ter of Mag­ic was about to ar­rive and in­tro­duce him­self

Nat­ural­ly, he had thought that the long cam­paign and the strain of the elec­tion had caused him to go mad. He had been ut­ter­ly ter­ri­fied to find a por­trait talk­ing to him, though this had been noth­ing to how he felt when a self­pro­claimed wiz­ard had bounced out of the fire­place and shak­en his hand. He had re­mained speech­less through­out Fudge’s kind­ly ex­pla­na­tion that there were witch­es and wiz­ards still liv­ing in se­cret all over the world and his re­as­sur­an­ces that he was not to both­er his head about them as the Min­istry of Mag­ic took re­spon­si­bil­ity for the whole Wiz­ard­ing com­mu­ni­ty and pre­vent­ed the non­mag­ical pop­ula­tion from get­ting wind of them. It was, said Fudge, a dif­fi­cult job that en­com­passed ev­ery­thing from reg­ula­tions on re­spon­si­ble use of broom­sticks to keep­ing the drag­on pop­ula­tion un­der con­trol (the Prime Min­is­ter re­mem­bered clutch­ing the desk for sup­port at this point). Fudge had then pat­ted the shoul­der of the still­dumb­struck Prime Min­is­ter in a fa­ther­ly sort of way.

“Not to wor­ry,” he had said, “it’s odd­son you’ll nev­er see me again. I’ll on­ly both­er you if there’s some­thing re­al­ly se­ri­ous go­ing on our end, some­thing that’s like­ly to af­fect the Mug­gles–the non­mag­ical pop­ula­tion, I should say. Oth­er­wise, it’s live and let live. And I must say, you’re tak­ing it a lot bet­ter than your pre­de­ces­sor. He tried to throw me out the win­dow, thought I was a hoax planned by the op­po­si­tion.”

At this, the Prime Min­is­ter had found his voice at last. “You’re–you’re not a hoax, then?”

It had been his last, des­per­ate hope.

“No,” said Fudge gen­tly. “No, I’m afraid I’m not. Look.”

And he had turned the Prime Min­is­ter’s teacup in­to a ger­bil.

“But,” said the Prime Min­is­ter breath­less­ly, watch­ing his teacup chew­ing on the cor­ner of his next speech, “but why–why has no­body told me–?”

“The Min­is­ter of Mag­ic on­ly re­veals him–or her­self to the Mug­gle Prime Min­is­ter of the day,” said Fudge, pok­ing his wand back in­side his jack­et. “We find it the best way to main­tain se­cre­cy.”

“But then,” bleat­ed the Prime Min­is­ter, “why hasn’t a for­mer Prime Min­is­ter warned me–?”

At this, Fudge had ac­tu­al­ly laughed.

“My dear Prime Min­is­ter, are you ev­er go­ing to tell any­body?”

Still chortling, Fudge had thrown some pow­der in­to the fire­place, stepped in­to the emer­ald flames, and van­ished with a whoosh­ing sound. The Prime Min­is­ter had stood there, quite mo­tion­less, and re­al­ized that he would nev­er, as long as he lived, dare men­tion this en­counter to a liv­ing soul, for who in the wide world would be­lieve him?

The shock had tak­en a lit­tle while to wear off. For a time, he had tried to con­vince him­self that Fudge had in­deed been a hal­lu­ci­na­tion brought on by lack of sleep dur­ing his gru­el­ing elec­tion cam­paign. In a vain at­tempt to rid him­self of all re­min­ders of this un­com­fort­able en­counter, he had giv­en the ger­bil to his de­light­ed niece and in­struct­ed his pri­vate sec­re­tary to take down the por­trait of the ug­ly lit­tle man who had an­nounced Fudge’s ar­ri­val. To the Prime Min­is­ter’s dis­may, how­ev­er, the por­trait had proved im­pos­si­ble to re­move. When sev­er­al car­pen­ters, a builder or two, an art his­to­ri­an, and the Chan­cel­lor of the Ex­che­quer had all tried un­suc­cess­ful­ly to pry it from the wall, the Prime Min­is­ter had aban­doned the at­tempt and sim­ply re­solved to hope that the thing re­mained mo­tion­less and silent for the rest of his term in of­fice. Oc­ca­sion­al­ly he could have sworn he saw out of the cor­ner of his eye the oc­cu­pant of the paint­ing yawn­ing, or else scratch­ing his nose; even, once or twice, sim­ply walk­ing out of his frame and leav­ing noth­ing but a stretch of mud­dy­brown can­vas be­hind. How­ev­er, he had trained him­self not to look at the pic­ture very much, and al­ways to tell him­self firm­ly that his eyes were play­ing tricks on him when any­thing like this hap­pened.

Then, three years ago, on a night very like tonight, the Prime Min­is­ter had been alone in his of­fice when the por­trait had once again an­nounced the im­mi­nent ar­ri­val of Fudge, who had burst out of the fire­place, sop­ping wet and in a state of con­sid­er­able pan­ic. Be­fore the Prime Min­is­ter could ask why he was drip­ping all over the Axmin­ster, Fudge had start­ed rant­ing about a prison the Prime Min­is­ter had nev­er heard of, a man named “Se­ri­ous” Black, some­thing that sound­ed like “Hog­warts,” and a boy called Har­ry Pot­ter, none of which made the re­motest sense to the Prime Min­is­ter.

“…I’ve just come from Azk­aban,” Fudge had pant­ed, tip­ping a large amount of wa­ter out of the rim of his bowler hat in­to his pock­et. “Mid­dle of the North Sea, you know, nasty flight… the de­men­tors are in up­roar”–he shud­dered–“they’ve nev­er had a break­out be­fore. Any­way, I had to come to you, Prime Min­is­ter. Black’s a known Mug­gle killer and may be plan­ning to re­join YouKnowWho… But of course, you don’t even know who YouKnowWho is!” He had gazed hope­less­ly at the Prime Min­is­ter for a mo­ment, then said, “Well, sit down, sit down, I’d bet­ter fill you in… Have a whiskey…”

The Prime Min­is­ter rather re­sent­ed be­ing told to sit down in his own of­fice, let alone of­fered his own whiskey, but he sat nev­er­the­less. Fudge pulled out his wand, con­ju­red two large glass­es full of am­ber liq­uid out of thin air, pushed one of them in­to the Prime Min­is­ter’s hand, and drew up a chair.

Fudge had talked for more than an hour. At one point, he had re­fused to say a cer­tain name aloud and wrote it in­stead on a piece of parch­ment, which he had thrust in­to the Prime Min­is­ter’s whiskeyfree hand. When at last Fudge had stood up to leave, the Prime Min­is­ter had stood up too.

“So you think that…” He had squint­ed down at the name in his left hand. “Lord Vol–“

“He­Who­Must­Not­Be­Named!” snarled Fudge.

“I’m sor­ry… You think that He­Who­Must­Not­Be­Named is still alive, then?”

“Well, Dum­ble­dore says he is,” said Fudge, as he had fas­tened his pin­striped cloak un­der his chin, “but we’ve nev­er found him. If you ask me, he’s not dan­ger­ous un­less he’s got sup­port, so it’s Black we ought to be wor­ry­ing about. You’ll put out that warn­ing, then? Ex­cel­lent. Well, I hope we don’t see each oth­er again, Prime Min­is­ter! Good night.”

But they had seen each oth­er again. Less than a year lat­er a ha­rass­ed­look­ing Fudge had ap­peared out of thin air in the cab­in­et room to in­form the Prime Min­is­ter that there had been a spot of both­er at the Kwid­ditch (or that was what it had sound­ed like) World Cup and that sev­er­al Mug­gles had been “in­volved,” but that the Prime Min­is­ter was not to wor­ry, the fact that YouKnowWho’s Mark had been seen again meant noth­ing; Fudge was sure it was an iso­lat­ed in­ci­dent, and the Mug­gle Li­ai­son Of­fice was deal­ing with all mem­ory mod­ifi­ca­tions as they spoke.

“Oh, and I al­most for­got,” Fudge had added. “We’re im­port­ing three for­eign drag­ons and a sphinx for the Tri­wiz­ard Tour­na­ment, quite rou­tine, but the De­part­ment for the Reg­ula­tion and Con­trol of Mag­ical Crea­tures tells me that it’s down in the rule book that we have to no­ti­fy you if we’re bring­ing high­ly dan­ger­ous crea­tures in­to the coun­try.”

“I–what–drag­ons?” splut­tered the Prime Min­is­ter.

“Yes, three,” said Fudge. “And a sphinx. Well, good day to you.”

The Prime Min­is­ter had hoped be­yond hope that drag­ons and sphinx­es would be the worst of it, but no. Less than two years lat­er, Fudge had erupt­ed out of the fire yet again, this time with the news that there had been a mass break­out from Azk­aban.

“A mass break­out?” re­peat­ed the Prime Min­is­ter hoarse­ly.

“No need to wor­ry, no need to wor­ry!” shout­ed Fudge, al­ready with one foot in the flames. “We’ll have them round­ed up in no time–just thought you ought to know!”

And be­fore the Prime Min­is­ter could shout, “Now, wait just one mo­ment!” Fudge had van­ished in a show­er of green sparks.

What­ev­er the press and the op­po­si­tion might say, the Prime Min­is­ter was not a fool­ish man. It had not es­caped his no­tice that, de­spite Fudge’s as­sur­an­ces at their first meet­ing, they were now see­ing rather a lot of each oth­er, nor that Fudge was be­com­ing more flus­tered with each vis­it. Lit­tle though he liked to think about the Min­is­ter of Mag­ic (or, as he al­ways called Fudge in his head, the Oth­er Min­is­ter), the Prime Min­is­ter could not help but fear that the next time Fudge ap­peared it would be with graver news still. The site, there­fore, of Fudge step­ping out of the fire once more, look­ing di­sheveled and fret­ful and stern­ly sur­prised that the Prime Min­is­ter did not know ex­act­ly why he was there, was about the worst thing that had hap­pened in the course of this ex­treme­ly gloomy week.

“How should I know what’s go­ing on in the–er–Wiz­ard­ing com­mu­ni­ty?” snapped the Prime Min­is­ter now. “I have a coun­try to run and quite enough con­cerns at the mo­ment with­out–“

“We have the same con­cerns,” Fudge in­ter­rupt­ed. “The Brock­dale Bridge didn’t wear out. That wasn’t re­al­ly a hur­ri­cane. Those mur­ders were not the work of Mug­gles. And Her­bert Chor­ley’s fam­ily would be safer with­out him. We are cur­rent­ly mak­ing ar­range­ments to have him trans­ferred to St. Mun­go’s Hos­pi­tal for Mag­ical Mal­adies and In­ju­ries. The move should be af­fect­ed tonight.”

“What do you… I’m afraid I… What?” blus­tered the Prime Min­is­ter.

Fudge took a great, deep breath and said, “Prime Min­is­ter, I am very sor­ry to have to tell you that he’s back. He­Who­Must­Not­Be­Named is back.”

“Back? When you say ‘back’… he’s alive? I mean–“

The Prime Min­is­ter groped in his mem­ory for the de­tails of that hor­ri­ble con­ver­sa­tion of three years pre­vi­ous­ly, when Fudge had told him about the wiz­ard who was feared above all oth­ers, the wiz­ard who had com­mit­ted a thou­sand ter­ri­ble crimes be­fore his mys­te­ri­ous dis­ap­pear­an­ce fif­teen years ear­li­er.

“Yes, alive,” said Fudge. “That is–I don’t know–is a man alive if he can’t be killed? I don’t re­al­ly un­der­stand it, and Dum­ble­dore won’t ex­plain prop­er­ly–but any­way, he’s cer­tain­ly got a body and is walk­ing and talk­ing and killing, so I sup­pose, for the pur­pos­es of our dis­cus­sion, yes, he’s alive.”

The Prime Min­is­ter did not know what to say to this, but a per­sis­tent habit of wish­ing to ap­pear wellin­formed on any sub­ject that came up made him cast around for any de­tails he could re­mem­ber of their pre­vi­ous con­ver­sa­tions.

“Is Se­ri­ous Black with–er–He­Who­Must­Not­Be­Named?”

“Black? Black?” said Fudge dis­tract­ed­ly, turn­ing his bowler rapid­ly in his fin­gers. “Sir­ius Black, you mean? Mer­lin’s beard, no. Black’s dead. Turns out we were–er–mis­tak­en about Black. He was in­no­cent af­ter all. And he wasn’t in league with He­Who­Must­Not­Be­Named ei­ther. I mean,” he added de­fen­sive­ly, spin­ning the bowler hat still faster, “all the ev­idence point­ed–we had more than fifty eye­wit­ness­es–but any­way, as I say, he’s dead. Mur­dered, as a mat­ter of fact. On Min­istry of Mag­ic premis­es. There’s go­ing to be an in­quiry, ac­tu­al­ly…”

To his great sur­prise, the Prime Min­is­ter felt a fleet­ing stab of pity for Fudge at this point. It was, how­ev­er, eclipsed al­most im­me­di­ate­ly by a glow of smug­ness at the thought that, de­fi­cient though he him­self might be in the area of ma­te­ri­al­iz­ing out of fire­places, there had nev­er been a mur­der in any of the gov­ern­ment de­part­ments un­der his charge… Not yet, any­way…

While the Prime Min­is­ter sur­rep­ti­tious­ly touched the wood of his desk, Fudge con­tin­ued, “But Blacks bythe­by now. The point is, we’re at war, Prime Min­is­ter, and steps must be tak­en.”

“At war?” re­peat­ed the Prime Min­is­ter ner­vous­ly. “Sure­ly that’s a lit­tle bit of an over­state­ment?”

“He­Who­Must­Not­Be­Named has now been joined by those of his fol­low­ers who broke out of Azk­aban in Jan­uary,” said Fudge, speak­ing more and more rapid­ly and twirling his bowler so fast that it was a limegreen blur. “Since they have moved in­to the open, they have been wreak­ing hav­oc. The Brock­dale Bridge–he did it, Prime Min­is­ter, he threat­ened a mass Mug­gle killing un­less I stood aside for him and–“

“Good grief, so it’s your fault those peo­ple were killed and I’m hav­ing to an­swer ques­tions about rust­ed rig­ging and cor­rod­ed ex­pan­sion joints and I don’t know what else!” said the Prime Min­is­ter fu­ri­ous­ly.

“My fault!” said Fudge, col­or­ing up. “Are you say­ing you would have caved in to black­mail like that?”

“Maybe not,” said the Prime Min­is­ter, stand­ing up and strid­ing about the room, “but I would have put all my ef­forts in­to catch­ing the black­mail­er be­fore he com­mit­ted any such atroc­ity!”

“Do you re­al­ly think I wasn’t al­ready mak­ing ev­ery ef­fort?” de­mand­ed Fudge heat­ed­ly. “Ev­ery Au­ror in the Min­istry was–and is–try­ing to find him and round up his fol­low­ers, but we hap­pen to be talk­ing about one of the most pow­er­ful wiz­ards of all time, a wiz­ard who has elud­ed cap­ture for al­most three decades!”

“So I sup­pose you’re go­ing to tell me he caused the hur­ri­cane in the West Coun­try too?” said the Prime Min­is­ter, his tem­per ris­ing with ev­ery pace he took. It was in­fu­ri­at­ing to dis­cov­er the rea­son for all these ter­ri­ble dis­as­ters and not to be able to tell the pub­lic, al­most worse than it be­ing the gov­ern­ment’s fault af­ter all.

“That was no hur­ri­cane,” said Fudge mis­er­ably.

“Ex­cuse me!” barked the Prime Min­is­ter, now pos­itive­ly stamp­ing up and down. “Trees up­root­ed, roofs ripped off, lamp­posts bent, hor­ri­ble in­ju­ries–“

“It was the Death Eaters,” said Fudge. “He­Who­Must­Not­Be­Named’s fol­low­ers. And… and we sus­pect gi­ant in­volve­ment.”

The Prime Min­is­ter stopped in his tracks as though he had hit an in­vis­ible wall. “What in­volve­ment?”

Fudge gri­maced. “He used gi­ants last time, when he want­ed to go for the grand ef­fect,” he said. “The Of­fice of Mis­in­for­ma­tion has been work­ing around the clock, we’ve had teams of Oblivi­ators out try­ing to mod­ify the mem­ories of all the Mug­gles who saw what re­al­ly hap­pened, we’ve got most of the De­part­ment for the Reg­ula­tion and Con­trol of Mag­ical Crea­tures run­ning around Som­er­set, but we can’t find the gi­ant–it’s been a dis­as­ter.”

“You don’t say!” said the Prime Min­is­ter fu­ri­ous­ly.

“I won’t de­ny that morale is pret­ty low at the Min­istry,” said Fudge. “What with all that, and then los­ing Amelia Bones.”

“Los­ing who?”

“Amelia Bones. Head of the De­part­ment of Mag­ical Law En­force­ment. We think He­Who­Must­Not­Be­Named may have mur­dered her in per­son, be­cause she was a very gift­ed witch and–and all the ev­idence was that she put up a re­al fight.”

Fudge cleared his throat and, with an ef­fort, it seemed, stopped spin­ning his bowler hat.

“But that mur­der was in the news­pa­pers,” said the Prime Min­is­ter, mo­men­tar­ily di­vert­ed from his anger. “Our news­pa­pers. Amelia Bones… it just said she was a mid­dleaged wom­an who lived alone. It was a–a nasty killing, wasn’t it? It’s had rather a lot of pub­lic­ity. The po­lice are baf­fled, you see.”

Fudge sighed. “Well, of course they are,” he said. “Killed in a room that was locked from the in­side, wasn’t she? We, on the oth­er hand, know ex­act­ly who did it, not that that gets us any fur­ther to­ward catch­ing him. And then there was Em­me­line Vance, maybe you didn’t hear about that one–“

“Oh yes I did!” said the Prime Min­is­ter. “It hap­pened just around the cor­ner from here, as a mat­ter of fact. The pa­pers had a field day with it, ‘break­down of law and or­der in the Prime Min­is­ter’s back­yard–’”

“And as if all that wasn’t enough,” said Fudge, bare­ly lis­ten­ing to the Prime Min­is­ter, “we’ve got de­men­tors swarm­ing all over the place, at­tack­ing peo­ple left, right, and cen­ter…”

Once up­on a hap­pi­er time this sen­tence would have been un­in­tel­li­gi­ble to the Prime Min­is­ter, but he was wis­er now.

“I thought de­men­tors guard the pris­on­ers in Azk­aban,” he said cau­tious­ly.

“They did,” said Fudge weari­ly. “But not any­more. They’ve de­sert­ed the prison and joined He­Who­Must­Not­Be­Named. I won’t pre­tend that wasn’t a blow.”

“But,” said the Prime Min­is­ter, with a sense of dawn­ing hor­ror, “didn’t you tell me they’re the crea­tures that drain hope and hap­pi­ness out of peo­ple?”

“That’s right. And they’re breed­ing. That’s what’s caus­ing all this mist.”

The Prime Min­is­ter sank, weakkneed, in­to the near­est chair. The idea of in­vis­ible crea­tures swoop­ing through the towns and coun­try­side, spread­ing de­spair and hope­less­ness in his vot­ers, made him feel quite faint.

“Now see here, Fudge–you’ve got to do some­thing! It’s your re­spon­si­bil­ity as Min­is­ter of Mag­ic!”

“My dear Prime Min­is­ter, you can’t hon­est­ly think I’m still Min­is­ter of Mag­ic af­ter all this? I was sacked three days ago! The whole Wiz­ard­ing com­mu­ni­ty has been scream­ing for my res­ig­na­tion for a fort­night. I’ve nev­er known them so unit­ed in my whole term of of­fice!” said Fudge, with a brave at­tempt at a smile.

The Prime Min­is­ter was mo­men­tar­ily lost for words. De­spite his in­dig­na­tion at the po­si­tion in­to which he had been placed, he still rather felt for the shrunk­en­look­ing man sit­ting op­po­site him.

“I’m very sor­ry,” he said fi­nal­ly. “If there’s any­thing I can do?”

“It’s very kind of you, Prime Min­is­ter, but there is noth­ing. I was sent here tonight to bring you up to date on re­cent events and to in­tro­duce you to my suc­ces­sor. I rather thought he’d be here by now, but of course, he’s very busy at the mo­ment, with so much go­ing on.”

Fudge looked around at the por­trait of the ug­ly lit­tle man wear­ing the long curly sil­ver wig, who was dig­ging in his ear with the point of a quill. Catch­ing Fudge’s eye, the por­trait said, “He’ll be here in a mo­ment, he’s just fin­ish­ing a let­ter to Dum­ble­dore.”

“I wish him luck,” said Fudge, sound­ing bit­ter for the first time. “I’ve been writ­ing to Dum­ble­dore twice a day for the past fort­night, but he won’t budge. If he’d just been pre­pared to per­suade the boy, I might still be… Well, maybe Scrim­geour will have more suc­cess.”

Fudge sub­sid­ed in­to what was clear­ly an ag­grieved si­lence, but it was bro­ken al­most im­me­di­ate­ly by the por­trait, which sud­den­ly spoke in its crisp, of­fi­cial voice.

“To the Prime Min­is­ter of Mug­gles. Re­quest­ing a meet­ing. Ur­gent. Kind­ly re­spond im­me­di­ate­ly. Ru­fus Scrim­geour, Min­is­ter of Mag­ic.”

“Yes, yes, fine,” said the Prime Min­is­ter dis­tract­ed­ly, and he bare­ly flinched as the flames in the grate turned emer­ald green again, rose up, and re­vealed a sec­ond spin­ning wiz­ard in their heart, dis­gorg­ing him mo­ments lat­er on­to the an­tique rug.

Fudge got to his feet and, af­ter a mo­ment’s hes­ita­tion, the Prime Min­is­ter did the same, watch­ing the new ar­ri­val straight­en up, dust down his long black robes, and look around.

The Prime Min­is­ter’s first, fool­ish thought was that Ru­fus Scrim­geour looked rather like an old li­on. There were streaks of gray in his mane of tawny hair and his bushy eye­brows; he had keen yel­low­ish eyes be­hind a pair of wirerimmed spec­ta­cles and a cer­tain rangy, lop­ing grace even though he walked with a slight limp. There was an im­me­di­ate im­pres­sion of shrewd­ness and tough­ness; the Prime Min­is­ter thought he un­der­stood why the Wiz­ard­ing com­mu­ni­ty pre­ferred Scrim­geour to Fudge as a lead­er in these dan­ger­ous times.

“How do you do?” said the Prime Min­is­ter po­lite­ly, hold­ing out his hand.

Scrim­geour grasped it briefly, his eyes scan­ning the room, then pulled out a wand from un­der his robes.

“Fudge told you ev­ery­thing?” he asked, strid­ing over to the door and tap­ping the key­hole with his wand. The Prime Min­is­ter heard the lock click.

“Er–yes,” said the Prime Min­is­ter. “And if you don’t mind, I’d rather that door re­mained un­locked.”

“I’d rather not be in­ter­rupt­ed,” said Scrim­geour short­ly, “or watched,” he added, point­ing his wand at the win­dows, so that the cur­tains swept across them. “Right, well, I’m a busy man, so let’s get down lo busi­ness. First of all, we need to dis­cuss your se­cu­ri­ty.”

The Prime Min­is­ter drew him­self up to his fullest height and replied, “I am per­fect­ly hap­py with the se­cu­ri­ty I’ve al­ready got, thank you very–“

“Well, we’re not,” Scrim­geour cut in. “It’ll be a poor look­out for the Mug­gles if their Prime Min­is­ter gets put un­der the Im­perius Curse. The new sec­re­tary in your out­er of­fice–“

“I’m not get­ting rid of Kings­ley Shack­le­bolt, if that’s what you’re sug­gest­ing!” said the Prime Min­is­ter hot­ly. “He’s high­ly ef­fi­cient, gets through twice the work the rest of them–“

“That’s be­cause he’s a wiz­ard,” said Scrim­geour, with­out a flick­er of a smile. “A high­ly trained Au­ror, who has been as­signed to you for your pro­tec­tion.”

“Now, wait a mo­ment!” de­clared the Prime Min­is­ter. “You can’t just put your peo­ple in­to my of­fice, I de­cide who works for me–“

“I thought you were hap­py with Shack­le­bolt?” said Scrim­geour cold­ly.

“I am–that’s to say, I was–“

“Then there’s no prob­lem, is there?” said Scrim­geour.

“I… well, as long as Shack­le­bolt’s work con­tin­ues to be… er… ex­cel­lent,” said the Prime Min­is­ter lame­ly, but Scrim­geour bare­ly seemed to hear him.

“Now, about Her­bert Chor­ley, your Ju­nior Min­is­ter,” he con­tin­ued. “The one who has been en­ter­tain­ing the pub­lic by im­per­son­at­ing a duck.”

“What about him?” asked the Prime Min­is­ter.

“He has clear­ly re­act­ed to a poor­ly per­formed Im­perius Curse,” said Scrim­geour. “It’s ad­dled his brains, but he could still be dan­ger­ous.”

“He’s on­ly quack­ing!” said the Prime Min­is­ter weak­ly. “Sure­ly a bit of a rest… Maybe go easy on the drink…”

“A team of Heal­ers from St. Mun­go’s Hos­pi­tal for Mag­ical Mal­adies and In­ju­ries are ex­am­in­ing him as we speak. So far he has at­tempt­ed to stran­gle three of them,” said Scrim­geour. “I think it best that we re­move him from Mug­gle so­ci­ety for a while.”

“I… well… He’ll be all right, won’t he?” said the Prime Min­is­ter anx­ious­ly.

Scrim­geour mere­ly shrugged, al­ready mov­ing back to­ward the fire­place.

“Well, that’s re­al­ly all I had to say. I will keep you post­ed of de­vel­op­ments, Prime Min­is­ter–or, at least, I shall prob­ably be too busy to come per­son­al­ly, in which case I shall send Fudge here. He has con­sent­ed to stay on in an ad­vi­so­ry ca­pac­ity.”

Fudge at­tempt­ed to smile, but was un­suc­cess­ful; he mere­ly looked as though he had a toothache. Scrim­geour was al­ready rum­mag­ing in his pock­et for the mys­te­ri­ous pow­der that turned the fire green. The Prime Min­is­ter gazed hope­less­ly at the pair of them for a mo­ment, then the words he had fought to sup­press all evening burst from him at last.

“But for heav­en’s sake–you’re wiz­ards! You can do mag­ic! Sure­ly you can sort out–well–any­thing!”

Scrim­geour turned slow­ly on the spot and ex­changed an in­cred­ulous look with Fudge, who re­al­ly did man­age a smile this time as he said kind­ly, “The trou­ble is, the oth­er side can do mag­ic too, Prime Min­is­ter.”

And with that, the two wiz­ards stepped one af­ter the oth­er in­to the bright green fire and van­ished.
