Chapter 23: Horcruxes


Har­ry could feel the Fe­lix Fe­li­cis wear­ing off as he creeped back in­to the cas­tle. The front door had re­mained un locked for him, but on the third floor he met Peeves and on­ly nar­row­ly avoid­ed de­tec­tion by div­ing side­ways through one of his short­cuts. By the time he got up to the por­trait of the Fat La­dy and pulled off his In­vis­ibil­ity Cloak, he was not sur­prised to find her in a most un­help­ful mood.

“What sort of time do you call this?”

“I’m re­al­ly sor­ry — I had to go out for some­thing im­por­tant —”

“Well, the pass­word changed at mid­night, so you’ll just have to sleep in the cor­ri­dor, won’t you?”

“You’re jok­ing!” said Har­ry. “Why did it have to change at mid­night?”

“That’s the way it is,” said the Fat La­dy. “If you’re an­gry, go and take it up with the head­mas­ter, he’s the one who’s tight­ened se­cu­ri­ty.”

“Fan­tas­tic,” said Har­ry bit­ter­ly, look­ing around at the hard floor. “Re­al­ly bril­liant. Yeah, I would go and take it up with Dum­ble­dore if he was here, be­cause he’s the one who want­ed me to —”

“He is here,” said a voice be­hind Har­ry. “Pro­fes­sor Dum­ble­dore re­turned to the school an hour ago.”

Near­ly Head­less Nick was glid­ing to­ward Har­ry, his head wob­bling as usu­al up­on his ruff.

“I had it from the Bloody Baron, who saw him ar­rive,” said Nick. “He ap­peared, ac­cord­ing to the Baron, to be in good spir­its, though a lit­tle tired, of course.”

“Where is he?” said Har­ry, his heart leap­ing,”

“Oh, groan­ing and clank­ing up on the As­tron­omy Tow­er, it’s a, fa­vorite pas­time of his —”

“Not the Bloody Baron — Dum­ble­dore!”

“Oh — in his of­fice,” said Nick. “I be­lieve, from what the Baron said, that he had busi­ness to at­tend to be­fore turn­ing in —”

“Yeah, he has,” said Har­ry, ex­cite­ment blaz­ing in his chest at the prospect of telling Dum­ble­dore he had se­cured the mem­ory. He wheeled about and sprint­ed off again, ig­nor­ing the Fat La­dy who was call­ing af­ter him.

“Come back! All right, I lied! I was an­noyed you woke me up! The pass­word’s still ‘tape­worm’!”

But Har­ry was al­ready hurtling back along the cor­ri­dor and with­in min­utes, he was say­ing “tof­fee eclairs” to Dum­ble­dore’s gar­goyle, which leapt aside, per­mit­ting Har­ry en­trance on­to the spi­ral stair­case.

“En­ter,” said Dum­ble­dore when Har­ry knocked. He sound­ed ex­haust­ed. Har­ry pushed open the door. There was Dum­ble­dore’s of­fice, look­ing the same as ev­er, but with black, starstrewn skies be­yond the win­dows.

“Good gra­cious, Har­ry,” said Dum­ble­dore in sur­prise. “To what do I owe this very late plea­sure?”

“Sir — I’ve got it. I’ve got the mem­ory from Slughorn.”

Har­ry pulled out the tiny glass bot­tle and showed it to Dum­ble­dore. For a mo­ment or two, the head­mas­ter looked stunned. Then his face split in a wide smile.

“Har­ry, this is spec­tac­ular news! Very well done in­deed! I knew you could do it!”

All thought of the late­ness of the hour ap­par­ent­ly for­got­ten, he hur­ried around his desk, took the bot­tle with Slughorn’s mem­ory in his un­in­ju­red hand, and strode over to the cab­in­et where he kepi the Pen­sieve.

“And now,” said Dum­ble­dore, plac­ing the stone basin up­on the desk and emp­ty­ing the con­tents of the bot­tle in­to it. “Now, at last. we shall see. Har­ry, quick­ly . . .”

Har­ry bowed obe­di­ent­ly over the Pen­sieve and felt his feet leave the of­fice floor. . . . Once again he fell through dark­ness and land­ed in Ho­race Slughorn’s of­fice many years be­fore. There was the much younger Slughorn, with his thick, shiny, straw­col­ored hair and his gin­gery­blond mus­tache, sit­ting again in the com­fort­able winged arm­chair in his of­fice, his feet rest­ing up­on a vel­vet pouffe, a small glass of wine in one hand, the oth­er rum­mag­ing in a box of crys­tal­lized pineap­ple. And there were the half dozen teenage boys sit­ting around Slughorn with Tom Rid­dle in the midst of them, Mar­vo­lo’s goldand­black ring gleam­ing on his fin­ger.

Dum­ble­dore land­ed be­side Har­ry just as Rid­dle asked, “Sir is it true that Pro­fes­sor Mer­ry­thought is re­tir­ing?”

“Tom, Tom, if I knew I couldn’t tell you,” said Slughorn, wag­ging his fin­ger re­prov­ing­ly at Rid­dle, though wink­ing at the same time. “I must say, I’d like to know where you get your in­for­ma­tion, boy, more knowl­edge­able than half the staff, you are.”

Rid­dle smiled; the oth­er boys laughed and cast him ad­mir­ing looks.

“What with your un­can­ny abil­ity to know things you shouldn’t, and your care­ful flat­tery of the peo­ple who mat­ter — thank you for the pineap­ple, by the way, you’re quite right, it is my fa­vorite —” Sev­er­al of the boys tit­tered again. “— I con­fi­dent­ly ex­pect you to rise to Min­is­ter of Mag­ic with­in twen­ty years. Fif­teen, if you keep send­ing me pineap­ple, I have ex­cel­lent con­tacts at the Min­istry.”

Tom Rid­dle mere­ly smiled as the oth­ers laughed again. Har­ry no­ticed that he was by no means the el­dest of the group of boys, but that they all seemed to look to him as their lead­er.

“I don’t know that pol­itics would suit me, sir,” he said when the laugh­ter had died away. “I don’t have the right kind of back­ground, for one thing.”

A cou­ple of the boys around him smirked at each oth­er. Har­ry was sure they were en­joy­ing a pri­vate joke, un­doubt­ed­ly about what they knew, or sus­pect­ed, re­gard­ing their gang lead­er’s fa­mous an­ces­tor.

“Non­sense,” said Slughorn briskly, “couldn’t be plain­er you come from de­cent Wiz­ard­ing stock, abil­ities like yours. No, you’ll go far, Tom, I’ve nev­er been wrong about a stu­dent yet.”

The small gold­en clock stand­ing up­on Slughorn’s desk chimed eleven o’clock be­hind him and he looked around.

“Good gra­cious, is it that time al­ready? You’d bet­ter get go­ing boys, or we’ll all be in trou­ble. Lestrange, I want your es­say by in mor­row or it’s de­ten­tion. Same goes for you, Av­ery.”

One by one, the boys filed out of the room. Slughorn heaved him­self out of his arm­chair and car­ried his emp­ty glass over to his desk. A move­ment be­hind him made him look around; Rid­dle was still stand­ing there.

“Look shar

p, Tom, you don’t want to be caught out of bed out of hours, and you a pre­fect.. .”

“Sir, I want­ed to ask you some­thing.” -’ “Ask away, then, m’boy, ask away. . . .”

“Sir, I won­dered what you know about. . . about Hor­crux­es?’

Slughorn stared at him, his thick ringers ab­sent­mind­ed­ly claw­ing the stem of his wine glass.

“Project for De­fense Against the Dark Arts, is it?”

But Har­ry could tell that Slughorn knew per­fect­ly well that this was not school­work.

“Not ex­act­ly, sir,” said Rid­dle. “I came across the term while read­ing and I didn’t ful­ly un­der­stand it.”

“No . . . well. . . you’d be hard­pushed to find a book at Hog­warts that’ll give you de­tails on Hor­crux­es, Tom, that’s very Dark stuff, very Dark in­deed,” said Slughorn.

“But you ob­vi­ous­ly know all about them, sir? I mean, a wiz­ard like you — sor­ry, I mean, if you can’t tell me, ob­vi­ous­ly — I just knew if any­one could tell me, you could — so I just thought I’d –“

It was very well done, thought Har­ry, the hes­itan­cy, the ca­su­al tone, the care­ful flat­tery, none of it over­done. He, Har­ry, had had too much ex­pe­ri­ence of try­ing to whee­dle in­for­ma­tion out of re­luc­tant peo­ple not to rec­og­nize a mas­ter at work. He could tell that Rid­dle want­ed the in­for­ma­tion very, very much; per­haps had been work­ing to­ward this mo­ment for weeks.

“Well,” said Slughorn, not look­ing at Rid­dle, but fid­dling with the rib­bon on top of his box of crys­tal­lized pineap­ple, “well, it can’t hurt to give you an overview, of course. Just so that you un­der­stand t he term. A Hor­crux is the word used for an ob­ject in which a per­son has con­cealed part of their soul.”

“I don’t quite un­der­stand how that works, though, sir,” said Rid­dle.

His voice was care­ful­ly con­trolled, but Har­ry could sense his ex­cite­ment.

“Well, you split your soul, you see,” said Slughorn, “and hide part of it in an ob­ject out­side the body. Then, even if one’s body is at­tacked or de­stroyed, one can­not die, for part of the soul re­mains earth­bound and un­dam­aged. But of course, ex­is­tence in such a form …”

Slughorn’s face crum­pled and Har­ry found him­self re­mem­ber­ing words he had heard near­ly two years be­fore: “I was ripped from my body, I was less than spir­it, less than the mean­est ghost. . . but still, I was alive.”

“… few would want it, Tom, very few. Death would be pre­fer­able.”

But Rid­dle’s hunger was now ap­par­ent; his ex­pres­sion was greedy, he could no longer hide his long­ing.

“How do you split your soul?”

“Well,” said Slughorn un­com­fort­ably, “you must un­der­stand that the soul is sup­posed to re­main in­tact and whole. Split­ting n it I an act of vi­ola­tion, it is against na­ture.”

“But how do you do it?”

“By an act of evil — the supreme act of evil. By com­mit­ing mur­der. Killing rips the soul apart. The wiz­ard in­tent up­on cre­at­ing a Hor­crux would use the dam­age to his ad­van­tage: He would en­case the torn por­tion —”

“En­case? But how — ?”

“There is a spell, do not ask me, I don’t know!” said Slughoin shak­ing his head like an old ele­phant both­ered by mosquitoes. ” Do I look as though I have tried it — do I look like a killer?”

“No, sir, of course not,” said Rid­dle quick­ly. “I’m sor­ry … I didn’t mean to of­fend . . .”

“Not at all, not at all, not of­fend­ed,” said Slughorn gruffly, “It is nat­ural to feel some cu­rios­ity about these things. . . . Wiz­ards of a cer­tain cal­iber have al­ways been drawn to that as­pect of mag­ic. . . .”

“Yes, sir,” said Rid­dle. “What I don’t un­der­stand, though — just out of cu­rios­ity — I mean, would one Hor­crux be much use? Can you on­ly split your soul once? Wouldn’t it be bet­ter, make you stronger, to have your soul in more pieces, I mean, for in­stance, isn’t sev­en the most pow­er­ful­ly mag­ical num­ber, wouldn’t sev­en — ?”

“Mer­lin’s beard, Tom!” yelped Slughorn. “Sev­en! Isn’t it bad enough to think of killing one per­son? And in any case . . . bad enough to di­vide the soul . . . but to rip it in­to sev­en pieces . . .”

Slughorn looked deeply trou­bled now: He was gaz­ing at Rid­dle as though he had nev­er seen him plain­ly be­fore, and Har­ry could tell that he was re­gret­ting en­ter­ing in­to the con­ver­sa­tion at all.

“Of course,” he mut­tered, “this is all hy­po­thet­ical, what we’re dis­cussing, isn’t it? All aca­dem­ic . . .”

“Yes, sir, of course,” said Rid­dle quick­ly.

“But all the same, Tom . . . keep it qui­et, what I’ve told — that’s to say, what we’ve dis­cussed. Peo­ple wouldn’t like to think we’ve been chat­ting about Hor­crux­es. It’s a banned sub­ject at Hog­warts, you know. . . . Dum­ble­dore’s par­tic­ular­ly fierce about it. …”

“I won’t say a word, sir,” said Rid­dle, and he left, but not be­fore Har­ry had glimpsed his face, which was full of that same wild hap­pi­ness it had worn when he had first found out that he was a wiz­ard, the sort of hap­pi­ness that did not en­hance his hand­some fea­tures, but made them, some­how, less hu­man. . . .

“Thank you, Har­ry,” said Dum­ble­dore qui­et­ly. “Let us go. . . .”

When Har­ry land­ed back on the of­fice floor Dum­ble­dore was ; al­ready sit­ting down be­hind his desk. Har­ry sat too and wait­ed for Dum­ble­dore to speak.

“I have been hop­ing for this piece of ev­idence for a very long time,” said Dum­ble­dore at last. “It con­firms the the­ory on which I have been work­ing, it tells me that I am right, and al­so how very far there is still to go. …”

Har­ry sud­den­ly no­ticed that ev­ery sin­gle one of the old head­mas­ters and head­mis­tress­es in the por­traits around the walls was awake and lis­ten­ing in on their con­ver­sa­tion. A cor­pu­lent, red nosed wiz­ard had ac­tu­al­ly tak­en out an ear trum­pet.

“Well, Har­ry,” said Dum­ble­dore, “I am sure you un­der­stood the sig­nif­icance of what we just heard. At the same age as you are now, give or take a few months, Tom Rid­dle was do­ing all he could to find out how to make him­self im­mor­tal.”

“You think he suc­ceed­ed then, sir?” asked Har­ry. “He made a Hor­crux? And that’s why he didn’t die when he at­tacked me? He had a Hor­crux hid­den some­where? A bit of his soul was safe?”

“A bit… or more,” said Dum­ble­dore. “You heard Volde­mort, what he par­tic­ular­ly want­ed from Ho­race was an opin­ion on what would hap­pen to the wiz­ard who cre­at­ed more than one Hor­crux, what would hap­pen to the wiz­ard so de­ter­mined to evade death that he would be pre­pared to mur­der many times, rip his soul re­peat­ed­ly, so as to store it in many, sep­arate­ly con­cealed Hor­cruxc. No book would have giv­en him that in­for­ma­tion. As far as I know — as far, I am sure, as Volde­mort knew — no wiz­ard had ev­er done more than tear his soul in two.”

Dum­ble­dore paused for a mo­ment, mar­shal­ing his thought, and then said, “Four years ago, I re­ceived what I con­sid­ered cer­tain proof that Volde­mort had split his soul.”

“Where?” asked Har­ry. “How?”

“You hand­ed it to me, Har­ry,” said Dum­ble­dore. “The di­ary, Rid­dles di­ary, the one giv­ing in­struc­tions on how to re­open the Cham­ber of Se­crets.”

“I don’t un­der­stand, sir,” said Har­ry.

“Well, al­though I did not see the Rid­dle who came out of the di­ary, what you de­scribed to me was a phe­nomenon I had nev­er wit­nessed. A mere mem­ory start­ing to act and think for it­self? A mere mem­ory, sap­ping the life out of the girl in­to whose hands it had fall­en? No, some­thing much more sin­is­ter had lived in­side that book. … a frag­ment of soul, I was al­most sure of it. The di­ary had been a Hor­crux. But this raised as many ques­tions as it an­swered. What in­trigued and alarmed me most was that that di­ary had been in­tend­ed as a weapon as much as a safe­guard.”

“1 still don’t un­der­stand,” said Har­ry.

“Well, it worked as a Hor­crux is sup­posed to work — in oth­er words, the frag­ment of soul con­cealed in­side it was kept safe and had un­doubt­ed­ly played its part in pre­vent­ing the death of its own­er. But there could be no doubt that Rid­dle re­al­ly want­ed that di­ary read, want­ed the piece of his soul to in­hab­it or pos­sess some­body else, so that Slytherin’s mon­ster would be un­leashed again.”

“Well, he didn’t want his hard work to be wast­ed,” said Har­ry. “He want­ed peo­ple to know he was Slytherin’s heir, be­cause he couldn’t take cred­it at the time.”

“Quite cor­rect,” said Dum­ble­dore, nod­ding. “But don’t you see, Har­ry, that if he in­tend­ed the di­ary to be passed to, or plant­ed on, some fu­ture Hog­warts stu­dent, he was be­ing re­mark­ably blase about that pre­cious frag­ment of his soul con­cealed with­in it. The point of a Hor­crux is, as Pro­fes­sor Slughorn ex­plained, to keep part of the self hid­den and safe, not to fling it in­to some­body else’s path and run the risk that they might de­stroy it — as in­deed hap­pened: That par­tic­ular frag­ment of soul is no more; you saw to that.

The care­less way in which Volde­mort re­gard­ed this Hor­crux seemed most omi­nous to me. It sug­gest­ed that he must have made — or had been plan­ning to make — more Hor­crux­es, so that the loss of his first would not be so de­tri­men­tal. I did not wish to be­lieve it, but noth­ing else seemed to make sense. Then you told me, two years lat­er, that on the night that Volde­mort re­turned to his body, he made a most il­lu­mi­nat­ing and alarm­ing state­ment to his Death Eaters. ‘I who have gone fur­ther than any­body along the path that leads to im­mor­tal­ity.’ That was what you told me he said. ‘Fur­ther than any­body!’ And I thought I knew what that meant, though the Death Eaters did not. He was re­fer­ring to his Hor­crux­es, Hor­crux­es in the plu­ral, Har­ry, which I don’t be­lieve any oth­er wiz­ard has ev­er had. Yet it fit­ted: Lord Vol­do­mort has seemed to grow less hu­man with the pass­ing years, and the trans­for­ma­tion he had un­der­gone seemed to me to be on­ly ex­plain­able if his soul was mu­ti­lat­ed be­yond the realms of what we might call ‘usu­al evil’ . . .”

“So he’s made him­self im­pos­si­ble to kill by mur­der­ing oth­er peo­ple?” said Har­ry. “Why couldn’t he make a Sor­cer­er’s Stone, or steal one, if he was so in­ter­est­ed in im­mor­tal­ity?”

“Well, we know that he tried to do just that, five years ago,” s;n«l Dum­ble­dore. “But there are sev­er­al rea­sons why, I think, a Sor­cer­er’s Stone would ap­peal less than Hor­crux­es to Lord Volde­mort,

“While the Elixir of Life does in­deed ex­tend life, it must lie drunk reg­ular­ly, for all eter­ni­ty, if the drinker is to main­tain the im­mor­tal­ity. There­fore, Volde­mort would be en­tire­ly de­pen­dant on the Elixir, and if it ran out, or was con­tam­inat­ed, or if the Stone was stolen, he would die just like any oth­er man. Volde­mort likes to op­er­ate alone, re­mem­ber. I be­lieve that he would have found the thought of be­ing de­pen­dent, even on the Elixir, in­tol­er­able. Of course he was pre­pared to drink it if it would take him out of the hor­ri­ble partlife to which he was con­demned af­ter at­tack­ing you, but on­ly to re­gain a body. There­af­ter, I am con­vinced, he in­tend­ed to con­tin­ue to re­ly on his Hor­crux­es. He would need noth­ing more, if on­ly he could re­gain a hu­man form. He was al­ready im­mor­tal, you see … or as close to im­mor­tal as any man can be. But now, Har­ry, armed with this in­for­ma­tion, the cru­cial mem­ory you have suc­ceed­ed in procur­ing for us, we are clos­er to the se­cret of fin­ish­ing Lord Volde­mort than any­one has ev­er been be­fore. You heard him, Har­ry: ‘Wouldn’t it be bet­ter, make you stronger, to have your soul in more pieces . . . isn’t sev­en the most pow­er­ful­ly mag­ical num­ber . . .’ Isn’t sev­en the most pow­er­ful­ly mag­ical num­ber. Yes, I think the idea of a sev­en­part soul would great­ly ap­peal to Lord Volde­mort.”

“He made sev­en Hor­crux­es?” said Har­ry, hor­rorstruck, while sev­er­al of the por­traits on the walls made sim­ilar nois­es of shock mid out­rage. “But they could be any­where in the world — hid­den — buried or in­vis­ible —”

“I am glad to see you ap­pre­ci­ate the mag­ni­tude of the prob­lem,” said Dum­ble­dore calm­ly. “But first­ly, no, Har­ry, not sev­en Hor­crux­es: six. The sev­enth part of his soul, how­ev­er maimed, re­sides in­side his re­gen­er­at­ed body. That was the part of him that lived a spec­tral ex­is­tence for so many years dur­ing his ex­ile; with­out that, he has no self at all. That sev­enth piece of soul will be the last that any­body wish­ing to kill Volde­mort must at­tack — the piece that lives in his body.”

“But the six Hor­crux­es, then,” said Har­ry, a lit­tle des­per­ate­ly, “how are we sup­posed to find them?”

“You are for­get­ting . . . you have al­ready de­stroyed one of them. And I have de­stroyed an­oth­er.”

“You have?” said Har­ry ea­ger­ly.

“Yes in­deed,” said Dum­ble­dore, and he raised his black­ened, burned­look­ing hand. “The ring, Har­ry. Mar­vo­lo’s ring. And a ter­ri­ble curse there was up­on it too. Had it not been — for­give me the lack of seem­ly mod­es­ty — for my own pro­di­gious skill, and for Pro­fes­sor Snape’s time­ly ac­tion when I re­turned to Hog­warts, des­per­ate­ly in­ju­red, I might not have lived to tell the tale. How­ev­er, a with­ered hand does not seem an un­rea­son­able ex­change for a sev­enth of Volde­mort’s soul. The ring is no longer a Hor­crux.”

“But how did you find it?”

“Well, as you now know, for many years I have made it my busi­ness to dis­cov­er as much as I can about Volde­mort’s past life. I have trav­eled wide­ly, vis­it­ing those places he once knew. I stum­bled across the ring hid­den in the ru­in of the Gaunt’s house. It seem that once Volde­mort had suc­ceed­ed in seal­ing a piece of his soul in side it, he did not want to wear it any­more. He hid it, pro­tect­ed by many pow­er­ful en­chant­ments, in the shack where his an­ces­tors had once lived (Morfin hav­ing been cart­ed off to Azk­aban, of course), nev­er guess­ing that I might one day take the trou­ble to vis­it the ru­in, or that I might be keep­ing an eye open for traces of mag­ical con­ceal­ment.

“How­ev­er, we should not con­grat­ulate our­selves too hearti­ly. You de­stroyed the di­ary and I the ring, but if we are right in our the­ory of a sev­en­part soul, four Hor­crux­es re­main.”

“And they could be any­thing?” said Har­ry. “They could be oh, in tin cans or, I dun­no, emp­ty po­tion bot­tles. . . .”

“You are think­ing of Portkeys, Har­ry, which must be or­di­nary ob­jects, easy to over­look. But would Lord Volde­mort use tin cans or old po­tion bot­tles to guard his own pre­cious soul? You are for­get­ting what I have showed you. Lord Volde­mort liked to col­lect tro­phies, and he pre­ferred ob­jects with a pow­er­ful mag­ical his­to­ry His pride, his be­lief in his own su­pe­ri­or­ity, his de­ter­mi­na­tion to carve for him­self a startling place in mag­ical his­to­ry; these things, sug­gest to me that Volde­mort would have cho­sen his Hor­cruxr with some care, fa­vor­ing ob­jects wor­thy of the hon­or.”

“The di­ary wasn’t that spe­cial.”

“The di­ary, as you have said your­self, was proof that he was the Hire of Slytherin. I am sure that Volde­mort con­sid­ered it of stu­pen­dous im­por­tance.”

“So, the oth­er Hor­crux­es?” said Har­ry. “Do you think you know what they are, sir?”

“I can on­ly guess,” said Dum­ble­dore. “For the rea­sons I have al­ready giv­en, I be­lieve that Lord Volde­mort would pre­fer ob­jects that, in them­selves, have a cer­tain grandeur. I have there­fore trawled back through Volde­mort’s past to see if I can find ev­idence that such ar­ti­facts have dis­ap­peared around him.”

“The lock­et!” said Har­ry loud­ly, “Huf­flepuff’s cup!”

“Yes,” said Dum­ble­dore, smil­ing, “I would be pre­pared to bet — per­haps not my oth­er hand — but a cou­ple of fin­gers, that they be­came Hor­crux­es three and four. The re­main­ing two, as­sum­ing again that he cre­at­ed a to­tal of six, are more of a prob­lem, but I will haz­ard a guess that, hav­ing se­cured ob­jects from Huf­flepuff and Slytherin, he set out to track down ob­jects owned by Gryffind­or or Raven­claw. Four ob­jects from the four founders would, I am sure, have ex­ert­ed a pow­er­ful pull over Volde­mort’s imag­ina­tion. I can­not an­swer for whether he ev­er man­aged to find any­thing of Raven­claw’s. I am con­fi­dent, how­ev­er, that the on­ly known rel­ic of Gryffind­or re­mains safe.”

Dum­ble­dore point­ed his black­ened fin­gers to the wall be­hind him, where a ru­byen­crust­ed sword re­posed with­in a glass case.

“Do you think that’s why he re­al­ly want­ed to come back to Hog­warts, sir?” said Har­ry. “To try and find some­thing from one of the oth­er founders?”

“My thoughts pre­cise­ly,” said Dum­ble­dore. “But un­for­tu­nate­ly, that does not ad­vance us much fur­ther, for he was turned away, or so I be­lieve, with­out the chance to search the school. I am forced to con­clude that he nev­er ful­filled his am­bi­tion of col­lect­ing four founders’ ob­jects. He def­inite­ly had two — he may have found three — that is the best we can do for now.”

“Even if he got some­thing of Raven­claw’s or of Gryffind­or’s, that leaves a sixth Hor­crux,” said Har­ry, count­ing on his fin­gers. “Un­less he’s got both?”

“I don’t think so,” said Dum­ble­dore. “I think I know what the sixth Hor­crux is. I won­der what you will say when I con­fess that I have been cu­ri­ous for a while about the be­hav­ior of the snake, Na­gi­ni?’

“The snake?” said Har­ry, star­tled. “You can use an­imals as Hor­crux­es?”

“Well, it is in­ad­vis­able to do so,” said Dum­ble­dore, “be­cause to con­fide a part of your soul to some­thing that can think and move for it­self is ob­vi­ous­ly a very risky busi­ness. How­ev­er, if my cal­cu­la­tions are cor­rect, Volde­mort was still at least one Hor­crux short of his goal of six when he en­tered your par­ents’ house with the in­ten­tion of killing you. He seems to have re­served the pro­cess of mak­ing Hor­crux­es for par­tic­ular­ly sig­nif­icant deaths. You would cer­tain­ly have been that. He be­lieved that in killing you, he was de­stroy­ing the dan­ger the prophe­cy had out­lined. He be­lieved he was mak­ing him­self in­vin­cible. I am sure that he was in­tend­ing to make his fi­nal Hor­crux with your death. As we know, he failed. Af­ter an in­ter­val of some years, how­ev­er, he used Na­gi­ni to kill an old Mug­gle man, and it might then have oc­curred to him to turn her in­to his last Hor­crux. She un­der­lines the Slytherin con­nec­tion, which en­hances Lord Volde­mor­ts mys­tique; I think he is per­haps as fond of her as he can be of any­thing; he cer­tain­ly likes to keep her close, and he seems to have an un­usu­al amount of con­trol over her, even for a Parsel­mouth.”

“So,” said Har­ry, “the di­ary’s gone, the ring’s gone. The cup, the lock­et, and the snake are still in­tact, and you think there might be a Hor­crux that was once Raven­claw’s or Gryffind­or’s?”

“An ad­mirably suc­cinct and ac­cu­rate sum­ma­ry, yes,” said Dum­ble­dore, bow­ing his head.

“So . . . are you still look­ing for them, sir? Is that where you’ve been go­ing when you’ve been leav­ing the school?”

“Cor­rect,” said Dum­ble­dore. “I have been look­ing for a very long time. I think. . . per­haps … I may be close to find­ing an­oth­er one. There are hope­ful signs.”

“And if you do,” said Har­ry quick­ly, “can I come with you and help get rid of it?”

Dum­ble­dore looked at Har­ry very in­tent­ly for a mo­ment be­fore say­ing, “Yes, I think so.”

“I can?” said Har­ry, thor­ough­ly tak­en aback.

“Oh yes,” said Dum­ble­dore, smil­ing slight­ly. “I think you have earned that right.”

Har­ry felt his heart lift. It was very good not to hear words of cau­tion and pro­tec­tion for once. The head­mas­ters and head­mis­tress­es around the walls seemed less im­pressed by Dum­ble­dore’s de­ci­sion; Har­ry saw a few of them shak­ing their heads and Phineas Nigel­lus ac­tu­al­ly snort­ed.

“Does Volde­mort know when a Hor­crux is de­stroyed, sir? Can he feel it?” Har­ry asked, ig­nor­ing the por­traits.

“A very in­ter­est­ing ques­tion, Har­ry. I be­lieve not. I be­lieve that Volde­mort is now so im­mersed in evil, and these cru­cial parts of him­self have been de­tached for so long, he does not feel as we do. Per­haps, at the point of death, he might be aware of his loss . . . but he was not aware, for in­stance, that the di­ary had been de­stroyed un­til he forced the truth out of Lu­cius Mal­foy. When Volde­mort dis­cov­ered that the di­ary had been mu­ti­lat­ed and robbed of all its pow­ers, I am told that his anger was ter­ri­ble to be­hold.”

“But I thought he meant Lu­cius Mal­foy to smug­gle it in­to Hog­warts?”

“Yes, he did, years ago, when he was sure he would be able to cre­ate more Hor­crux­es, but still Lu­cius was sup­posed to wait for Volde­mor­ts sayso, and he nev­er re­ceived it, for Volde­mort van­ished short­ly af­ter giv­ing him the di­ary. No doubt he thought that Lu­cius would not dare do any­thing with the Hor­crux oth­er than guard it care­ful­ly, but he was count­ing too much up­on Lu­cius’s fear of a mas­ter who had been gone for years and whom Lu­cius be­lieved dead. Of course, Lu­cius did not know what the di­ary re­al­ly was. I un­der­stand that Volde­mort had told him the di­ary would cause the Cham­ber of Se­crets to re­open be­cause it was clev­er­ly en­chant­ed. Had Lu­cius known he held a por­tion of his mas­ters soul in his hands, he would un­doubt­ed­ly have treat­ed it with more rev­er­ence — but in­stead he went ahead and car­ried out the old plan for his own ends. By plant­ing the di­ary up­on Arthur Weasleys daugh­ter, he hoped to dis­cred­it Arthur and get rid of a high­ly in­crim­inat­ing mag­ical ob­ject in one stroke. Ah, poor Lu­cius . . . what with Volde­mor­ts fury about the fact that he threw away the Hor­crux for his own gain, and the fi­as­co at the Min­istry last year, I would not be sur­prised if he is not se­cret­ly glad to be safe in Azk­aban at the mo­ment.”

Har­ry sat in thought for a mo­ment, then asked, “So if all of his Hor­crux­es are de­stroyed, Volde­mort couldbe killed?”

“Yes, I think so,” said Dum­ble­dore. “With­out his Hor­crux­es, Volde­mort will be a mor­tal man with a maimed and di­min­ished soul. Nev­er for­get, though, that while his soul may be dam­aged be­yond re­pair, his brain and his mag­ical pow­ers re­main in­tact. It will take un­com­mon skill and pow­er to kill a wiz­ard like Volde­mort even with­out his Hor­crux­es.”

“But I haven’t got un­com­mon skill and pow­er,” said Har­ry, be­fore he could stop him­self.

“Yes, you have,” said Dum­ble­dore firm­ly. “You have a pow­er that Volde­mort has nev­er had. You can —”

“I know!” said Har­ry im­pa­tient­ly. “I can love!” It was on­ly with dif­fi­cul­ty that he stopped him­self adding, “Big deal!”

“Yes, Har­ry, you can love,” said Dum­ble­dore, who looked as though he knew per­fect­ly well what Har­ry had just re­frained from say­ing. “Which, giv­en ev­ery­thing that has hap­pened to you, is a great and re­mark­able thing. You are still too young to un­der­stand how un­usu­al you are, Har­ry.”

“So, when the prophe­cy says that I’ll have ‘pow­er the Dark Lord knows not,’ it just means — love?” asked Har­ry, feel­ing a lit­tle let down.

“Yes — just love,” said Dum­ble­dore. “But Har­ry, nev­er for­get that what the prophe­cy says is on­ly sig­nif­icant be­cause Volde­mort made it so. I told you this at the end of last year. Volde­mort sin­gled you out as the per­son who would be most dan­ger­ous to him — and in do­ing so, he made you the per­son who would be most dan­ger­ous to him!”

“But it comes to the same —”

“No, it doesn’t!” said Dum­ble­dore, sound­ing im­pa­tient now. Point­ing at Har­ry with his black, with­ered hand, he said, “You are set­ting too much store by the prophe­cy!”

“But,” splut­tered Har­ry, “but you said the prophe­cy means —“

“If Volde­mort had nev­er heard of the prophe­cy, would it have been ful­filled? Would it have meant any­thing? Of course not! Ho you think ev­ery prophe­cy in the Hall of Prophe­cy has been ful­filled?”

“But,” said Har­ry, be­wil­dered, “but last year, you said one of us would have to kill the oth­er —”

“Har­ry, Har­ry, on­ly be­cause Volde­mort made a grave er­ror, and act­ed on Pro­fes­sor Trelawney’s words! If Volde­mort had nev­er mur­dered your fa­ther, would he have im­part­ed in you a fu­ri­ous de­sire for re­venge? Of course not! If he had not forced your moth­er to die for you, would he have giv­en you a mag­ical pro­tec­tion he could not pen­etrate? Of course not, Har­ry! Don’t you see? Volde­mort him­self cre­at­ed his worst en­emy, just as tyrants ev­ery­where do! Have you any idea how much tyrants fear the peo­ple they op­press? All of them re­al­ize that, one day, amongst their many vic­tims, there is sure to be one who ris­es against them and strikes back! Volde­mort is no dif­fer­ent! Al­ways he was on the look­out for the one who would chal­lenge him. He heard the prophe­cy and he leapt in­to ac­tion, with the re­sult that he not on­ly hand­picked the man most like­ly to fin­ish him, he hand­ed him unique­ly dead­ly weapons!”

“But —”

“It is es­sen­tial that you un­der­stand this!” said Dum­ble­dore, stand­ing up and strid­ing about the room, his glit­ter­ing robes swoosh­ing in his wake; Har­ry had nev­er seen him so ag­itat­ed. “By at­tempt­ing to kill you, Volde­mort him­self sin­gled out the re­mark­able per­son who sits here in front of me, and gave him the tools for the job! It is Volde­mort’s fault that you were able to see in­to his thoughts, his am­bi­tions, that you even un­der­stand the snake­like lan­guage in which he gives or­ders, and yet, Har­ry, de­spite your priv­ileged in­sight in­to Volde­mort’s world (which, in­ci­den­tal­ly, is a gift any Death Eater would kill to have), you have nev­er been se­duced by the Dark Arts, nev­er, even for a sec­ond, shown the slight­est de­sire to be­come one of Volde­mort’s fol­low­ers!”

“Of course I haven’t!” said Har­ry in­dig­nant­ly. “He killed my mum and dad!”

“You are pro­tect­ed, in short, by your abil­ity to love!” said Dum­ble­dore loud­ly. “The on­ly pro­tec­tion that can pos­si­bly work against the lure of pow­er like Volde­mort’s! In spite of all the temp­ta­tion you have en­dured, all the suf­fer­ing, you re­main pure of heart, just as pure as you were at the age of eleven, when you stared in­to a mir­ror that re­flect­ed your heart’s de­sire, and it showed you on­ly the way to thwart Lord Volde­mort, and not im­mor­tal­ity or rich­es. Har­ry, have you any idea how few wiz­ards could have seen what you saw in that mir­ror? Volde­mort should have known then what he was deal­ing with, but he did not! But he knows it now. You have flit­ted in­to Lord Volde­mort’s mind with­out dam­age to your­self, but he can­not pos­sess you with­out en­dur­ing mor­tal agony, as he dis­cov­ered in the Min­istry. I do not think he un­der­stands why, Har­ry, but then, he was in such a hur­ry to mu­ti­late his own soul, he nev­er paused to un­der­stand the in­com­pa­ra­ble pow­er of a soul that is un­tar­nished and whole.”

“But, sir,” said Har­ry, mak­ing valiant ef­forts not to sound ar­gu­men­ta­tive, “it all comes to the same thing, doesn’t it? I’ve got to try and kill him, or —”

“Got to?” said Dum­ble­dore. “Of course you’ve got to! But not be­cause of the prophe­cy! Be­cause you, your­self, will nev­er rest un­til you’ve tried! We both know it! Imag­ine, please, just for a mo­ment,

that you had nev­er heard that prophe­cy! How would you feel about Volde­mort now? Think!”

Har­ry watched Dum­ble­dore strid­ing up and down in front ol him, and thought. He thought of his moth­er, his fa­ther, and Si­nus. He thought of Cedric Dig­gory. He thought of all the ter­ri­ble deeds he knew Lord Volde­mort had done. A flame seemed to leap in­side his chest, sear­ing his throat.

“I’d want him fin­ished,” said Har­ry qui­et­ly. “And I’d want to do it.”

“Of course you would!” cried Dum­ble­dore. “You see, the prophe­cy does not mean you have to do any­thing! But the prophe­cy caused Lord Volde­mort to mark you as his equal. … In oth­er words, you are free to choose your way, quite free to turn your back on the prophe­cy! But Volde­mort con­tin­ues to set store by the prophe­cy. He will con­tin­ue to hunt you . . . which makes it cer­tain, re­al­ly, that —”

“That one of us is go­ing to end up killing the oth­er,” said Har­ry. “Yes.”

But he un­der­stood at last what Dum­ble­dore had been try­ing to tell him. It was, he thought, the dif­fer­ence be­tween be­ing dragged in­to the are­na to face a bat­tle to the death and walk­ing in­to the are­na with your head held high. Some peo­ple, per­haps, would say that there was lit­tle to choose be­tween the two ways, but Dum­ble­dore knew — and so do I, thought Har­ry, with a rush of fierce pride, and so did my par­ents — that there was all the dif­fer­ence in the world.
