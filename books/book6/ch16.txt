Chapter 16: AVeryFrosty Christmas


“So Snape was of­fer­ing to help him? He was def­inite­ly of­fer­ing to help him?”

“If you ask. that once more,” said Har­ry, “I’m go­ing to stick this sprout —”

“I’m on­ly check­ing!” said Ron. They were stand­ing alone at the Bur­row’s kitchen sink, peel­ing a moun­tain of sprouts for Mrs. Weasley. Snow was drift­ing past the win­dow in front of them.

“Yes, Snape was of­fer­ing to help him!” said Har­ry. “He said he’d promised Mal­foy’s moth­er to pro­tect him, that he’d made an Un­break­able Oath or some­thing —”

“An Un­break­able Vow?” said Ron, look­ing stunned. “Nah, he can’t have. . . . Are you sure?”

“Yes, I’m sure,” said Har­ry. “Why, what does it mean?”

“Well, you can’t break an Un­break­able Vow. . . .”

“I’d worked that much out for my­self, fun­ni­ly enough. What hap­pens if you break it, then?”

“You die,” said Ron sim­ply. “Fred and George tried to get me to make one when I was about five. I near­ly did too, I was hold­ing hands with Fred and ev­ery­thing when Dad found us. He went men­tal,” said Ron, with a rem­inis­cent gleam in his eyes. “On­ly time I’ve ev­er seen Dad as an­gry as Mum, Fred reck­ons his left but­tock has nev­er been the same since.”

“Yeah, well, pass­ing over Fred’s left but­tock —”

“I beg your par­don?” said Fred’s voice as the twins en­tered the kitchen.

“Aaah, George, look at this. They’re us­ing knives and ev­ery­thing. Bless them.”

“I’ll be sev­en­teen in two and a bit months’ time,” said Ron grumpi­ly, “and then I’ll be able to do it by mag­ic!”

“But mean­while,” said George, sit­ting down at the kitchen ta­ble and putting his feet up on it, “we can en­joy watch­ing you de­mon­strate the cor­rect use of a — whoop­sadaisy!”

“You made me do that!” said Ron an­gri­ly, suck­ing his cut thumb. “You wait, when I’m sev­en­teen —”

“I’m sure you’ll daz­zle us all with hith­er­to un­sus­pect­ed mag­ical skills,” yawned Fred.

“And speak­ing of hith­er­to un­sus­pect­ed skills, Ronald,” said George, “what is this we hear from Gin­ny about you and a young la­dy called — un­less our in­for­ma­tion is faulty — Laven­der Brown?”

Ron turned a lit­tle pink, but did not look dis­pleased as he turned back to the sprouts. “Mind your own busi­ness.”

“What a snap­py re­tort,” said Fred. “I re­al­ly don’t know how you think of them. No, what we want­ed to know was… how did it hap­pen?”

“What d’you mean?”

“Did she have an ac­ci­dent or some­thing?”

“What?” ..¦;

“Well, how did she sus­tain such ex­ten­sive brain dam­age? Care­ful, now!”

Mrs. Weasley en­tered the room just in time to see Ron throw the sprout knife at Fred, who had turned it in­to a pa­per air­plane with one lazy flick of his wand,

“Ron!” she said fu­ri­ous­ly. “Don’t you ev­er let me see you throw­ing knives again!”

“I wont,” said Ron, “let you see,” he added un­der his breath, as he turned back to the sprout moun­tain.

“Fred, George, I’m sor­ry, dears, but Re­mus is ar­riv­ing tonight, so Bill will have to squeeze in with you two.” ;

“No prob­lem,” said George.

- “Then, as Char­lie isn’t com­ing home, that just leaves Har­ry and ;¦/ Ron in the at­tic, and if Fleur shares with Gin­ny —” “— that’ll make Gin­ny’s Christ­mas —” mut­tered Fred. “— ev­ery­one should be com­fort­able. Well, they’ll have a bed, any­way,” said Mrs. Weasley, sound­ing slight­ly ha­rassed.

“Per­cy def­inite­ly not show­ing his ug­ly face, then?” asked Fred. Mrs. Weasley turned away be­fore she an­swered. “No, he’s busy, I ex­pect, at the Min­istry.”

“Or he’s the world’s biggest prat,” said Fred, as Mrs. Weasley left the kitchen. “One of the two. “Well, let’s get go­ing, then, George.”

“What are you two up to?” asked Ron. “Cant you help us with these sprouts? You could just use your wand and then we’ll be free

too!”

“No, I don’t think we can do that,” said Fred se­ri­ous­ly. “It’s very char­ac­ter­build­ing stuff, learn­ing to peel sprouts with­out mag­ic, makes you ap­pre­ci­ate how dif­fi­cult it is for Mug­gles and Squibs —” “— and if you want peo­ple to help you, Ron,” added George, throw­ing the pa­per air­plane at him, “I wouldn’t chuck knives at them. Just a lit­tle hint. We’re off to the vil­lage, there’s a very pret­ty girl work­ing in the pa­per shop who thinks my card tricks are some­thing mar­velous . . , al­most like re­al mag­ic. …”

“Gits,” said Ron dark­ly, watch­ing Fred and George set­ting off across the snowy yard. “Would’ve on­ly tak­en them ten sec­onds and then we could’ve gone too.”

“I couldn’t,” said Har­ry. “I promised Dum­ble­dore I wouldn’t wan­der off while I’m stay­ing here.”

“Oh yeah,” said Ron. He peeled a few more sprouts and then said, “Are you go­ing to tell Dum­ble­dore what you heard Snape and Mal­foy say­ing to each oth­er?”

“Yep,” said Har­ry. “I’m go­ing to tell any­one who can put a stop to it, and Dum­ble­dore’s top of the list. I might have an­oth­er word with your dad too.”

“Pity you didn’t hear what Mal­foy’s ac­tu­al­ly do­ing, though.” “I couldn’t have done, could I? That was the whole point, he was re­fus­ing to tell Snape.”

There was si­lence for a mo­ment or two, then Ron said, ” ‘Course, you know what they’ll all say? Dad and Dum­ble­dore and all of them? They’ll say Snape isn’t re­al­ly try­ing to help Mal­foy, he was just try­ing to find out what Mal­foy’s up to.”

“They didn’t hear him,” said Har­ry flat­ly. “No one’s that good an ac­tor, not even Snape.”

“Yeah . . . I’m just say­ing, though/’ said Ron.

Har­ry turned to face him, frown­ing. “You think I’m right, though?” ,

“Yeah, I do!” said Ron hasti­ly. “Se­ri­ous­ly, I do! But they’re all con­vinced Snape’s in the Or­der, aren’t they?”

Har­ry said noth­ing. It had al­ready oc­curred to him that this would be the most like­ly ob­jec­tion to his new ev­idence; he could hear Hermione now: Ob­vi­ous­ly, Har­ry, he was pre­tend­ing to of­fer help so he could trick Mal­foy in­to telling him what he’s do­ing. . . .

This was pure imag­ina­tion, how­ev­er, as he had had no op­por­tu­ni­ty to tell Hermione what he had over­heard. She had dis­ap­peared from Slughorn’s par­ty be­fore he re­turned to it, or so he had been in­formed by an irate McLaggen, and she had al­ready gone to bed by the time he re­turned to the com­mon room. As he and Ron had left for the Bur­row ear­ly the next day, he had bare­ly had time to wish her a hap­py Christ­mas and to tell her that he had some very im­por­tant news when they got back from the hol­idays. He was not en­tire­ly sure that she had heard him, though; Ron and Laven­der had been say­ing a thor­ough­ly non­ver­bal good­bye just be­hind him at the time.

Still, even Hermione would not be able to de­ny one thing: Mal­foy was def­inite­ly up to some­thing, and Snape knew it, so Har­ry felt ful­ly jus­ti­fied in say­ing “I told you so,” which he had done sev­er­al times to Ron al­ready.

Har­ry did not get the chance to speak to Mr. Weasley, who was work­ing very long hours at the Min­istry, un­til Christ­mas Eve night. The Weasleys and their guests were sit­ting in the liv­ing room, which Gin­ny had dec­orat­ed so lav­ish­ly that it was rather like sit­ting in a pa­per­chain ex­plo­sion. Fred, George, Har­ry, and Ron were the on­ly ones who knew that the an­gel on top of the tree was ac­tu­al­ly a gar­den gnome that had bit­ten Fred on the an­kle as hr pulled up car­rots for Christ­mas din­ner. Stu­pe­fied, paint­ed gold, stuffed in­to a minia­ture tu­tu and with small wings glued to il.s back, it glow­ered down at them all, the ugli­est an­gel Har­ry had ev­er seen, with a large bald head like a pota­to and rather hairy feet.

They were all sup­posed to be lis­ten­ing to a Christ­mas broad­cast by Mrs. Weasleys fa­vorite singer, Ce­lesti­na War­beck, whose voice was war­bling out of the large wood­en wire­less set. Fleur, who seemed to find Ce­lesti­na very dull, was talk­ing so loud­ly in the cor­ner that a scowl­ing Mrs. Weasley kept point­ing her wand at the vol­ume con­trol, so that Ce­lesti­na grew loud­er and loud­er. Un­der cov­er of a par­tic­ular­ly jazzy num­ber called “A Caul­dron Full of Hot, Strong Love,” Fred and George start­ed a game of Ex­plod­ing Snap with Gin­ny. Ron kept shoot­ing Bill and Fleur covert looks, as though hop­ing to pick up tips. Mean­while, Re­mus Lupin, who was thin­ner and more ragged­look­ing than ev­er, was sit­ting be­side the fire, star­ing in­to its depths as though he could not hear Ce­lesti­nas voice.

Oh, come and stir my caul­dron,

And if you do it right,

I’ll boil you up some hot strong love

To keep you warm tonight.

“We danced to this when we were eigh­teen!” said Mrs. Weasley, wip­ing her eyes on her knit­ting. “Do you re­mem­ber, Arthur?”

“Mphf?” said Mr. Weasley, whose head had been nod­ding over the sat­suma he was peel­ing. “Oh yes … mar­velous tune . . .”

With an ef­fort, he sat up a lit­tle straighter and looked around at Har­ry, who was sit­ting next to him.

“Sor­ry about this,” he said, jerk­ing his head to­ward the wire­less as Ce­lesti­na broke in­to the cho­rus. “Be over soon.”

“No prob­lem,” said Har­ry, grin­ning. “Has it been busy at the Min­istry?”

“Very,” said Mr. Weasley. “I wouldn’t mind if we were get­ting any­where, but of the three ar­rests we’ve made in the last cou­ple of months, I doubt that one of them is a gen­uine Death Eater — on­ly don’t re­peat that, Har­ry,” he added quick­ly, look­ing much more awake all of a sud­den.

“They’re not still hold­ing Stan Shun­pike, are they?” asked Har­ry.

“I’m afraid so,” said Mr. Weasley. “I know Dum­ble­dore’s tried ap­peal­ing di­rect­ly to Scrim­geour about Stan. … I mean, any­body who has ac­tu­al­ly in­ter­viewed him agrees that he’s about as much a Death Eater as this sat­suma . . . but the top lev­els want to look as though they’re mak­ing some progress, and ‘three ar­rests’ sounds bet­ter than ‘three mis­tak­en ar­rests and re­leas­es’. . . but again, this is

all top se­cret. . . .”

“I won’t say any­thing,” said Har­ry. He hes­itat­ed for a mo­ment, won­der­ing how best to em­bark on what he want­ed to say; as he mar­shaled his thoughts, Ce­lesti­na War­beck be­gan a bal­lad called “You Charmed the Heart Right Out of Me.”

“Mr. Weasley, you know what I told you at the sta­tion when we were set­ting off for school?”

“I checked, Har­ry,” said Mr. Weasley at once. “I went and searched the Mal­foys’ house. There was noth­ing, ei­ther bro­ken or whole, that shouldn’t have been there.”

“Yeah, I know, I saw in the Prophet that you’d looked . . . but this is some­thing dif­fer­ent. . . . Well, some­thing more …”

And he told Mr. Weasley ev­ery­thing he had over­heard be­tween

Mal­foy and Snape, As Har­ry spoke, he saw Lupin’s head turn a lit­tle to­ward him, tak­ing in ev­ery word. When he had fin­ished, there was si­lence, ex­cept for Ce­lesti­na’s croon­ing.

Oh, my poor heart, where has it gone? It’s left me for a spell…

“Has it oc­curred to you, Har­ry,” said Mr. Weasley, “that Snape was sim­ply pre­tend­ing — ?”

“Pre­tend­ing to of­fer help, so that he could find out what Mal­foy’s up to?” said Har­ry quick­ly. “Yeah, I thought you’d say that. But how do we know?”

“It isn’t our busi­ness to know,” said Lupin un­ex­pect­ed­ly. He had turned his back on the fire now and faced Har­ry across Mr. Weasley. “It’s Dum­ble­dore’s busi­ness. Dum­ble­dore trusts Severus, and that ought to be good enough for all of us.”

“But,” said Har­ry, “just say — just say Dum­ble­dores wrong about Snape —”

“Peo­ple have said it, many times. It comes down to whether or not you trust Dum­ble­dore’s judg­ment. I do; there­fore, I trust Severus.”

“But Dum­ble­dore can make mis­takes,” ar­gued Har­ry. “He says it him­self. And you” — he looked Lupin straight in the eye — “do you hon­est­ly like Snape?”

“I nei­ther like nor dis­like Severus,” said Lupin. “No, Har­ry, I am speak­ing the truth,” he added, as Har­ry pulled a skep­ti­cal ex­pres­sion. “We shall nev­er be bo­som friends, per­haps; af­ter all that hap­pened be­tween James and Sir­ius and Severus, there is too much bit­ter­ness there. But I do not for­get that dur­ing the year I taught at Hog­warts, Severus made the Wolfs­bane Po­tion for me ev­ery month, made it per­fect­ly, so that I did not have to suf­fer as I usu­al­ly do at the full moon.”

“But he ‘ac­ci­den­tal­ly’ let it slip that you’re a were­wolf, so you had to leave!” said Har­ry an­gri­ly.

Lupin shrugged. “The news would have leaked out any­way. We both know he want­ed my job, but he could have wreaked much worse dam­age on me by tam­per­ing with the po­tion. He kept me healthy. I must be grate­ful.”

“Maybe he didn’t dare mess with the po­tion with Dum­ble­dore watch­ing him!” said Har­ry.

“You are de­ter­mined to hate him, Har­ry,” said Lupin with a faint smile. “And I un­der­stand; with James as your fa­ther, with Sir­ius as your god­fa­ther, you have in­her­it­ed an old prej­udice. By all means tell Dum­ble­dore what you have told Arthur and me, but do not ex­pect him to share your view of the mat­ter; do not even ex­pect him to be sur­prised by what you tell him. It might have been on Dum­ble­dore’s or­ders that Severus ques­tioned Dra­co.” ;

. . . and now you’ve torn it quite apart I’ll thank you to give back my heart!

Ce­lesti­na end­ed her song on a very long, high­pitched note and loud ap­plause is­sued out of the wire­less, which Mrs. Weasley joined in with en­thu­si­as­ti­cal­ly.

“Eez eet over?” said Fleur loud­ly. “Thank good­ness, what an ‘or­ri­ble —”

“Shall we have a night­cap, then?” asked Mr. Weasley loud­ly, leap­ing to his feet. “Who wants eggnog?”

“What have you been up to late­ly?” Har­ry asked Lupin, as Mr, Weasley bus­tled off to fetch the eggnog, and ev­ery­body else stretched and broke in­to con­ver­sa­tion.

“Oh, I’ve been un­der­ground,” said Lupin. “Al­most lit­er­al­ly. That’s why I haven’t been able to write, Har­ry; send­ing let­ters to you would have been some­thing of a give­away.” -:

“What do you mean?” ‘

“I’ve been liv­ing among my fel­lows, my equals,” said Lupin. “Were­wolves,” he added, at Har­rys look of in­com­pre­hen­sion. “Near­ly all of them are on Volde­mort’s side. Dum­ble­dore want­ed a spy and here I was . . . ready­made.”

He sound­ed a lit­tle bit­ter, and per­haps re­al­ized it, for he smiled more warm­ly as he went on, “I am not com­plain­ing; it is nec­es­sary work and who can do it bet­ter than I? How­ev­er, it has been dif­fi­cult gain­ing their trust. I bear the un­mis­tak­able signs of hav­ing tried to live among wiz­ards, you see, where­as they have shunned nor­mal so­ci­ety and live on the mar­gins, steal­ing — and some­times killing — to eat.”

“How come they like Volde­mort?”

“They think that, un­der his rule, they will have a bet­ter life,” said Lupin. “And it is hard to ar­gue with Grey­back out there. . . .”

“Who’s Grey­back?”

“You haven’t heard of him?” Lupin’s hands closed con­vul­sive­ly in his lap. “Fen­rir Grey­back is, per­haps, the most sav­age were­wolf alive to­day. He re­gards it as his mis­sion in life to bite and to con­ta­mi­nate as many peo­ple as pos­si­ble; he wants to cre­ate enough were­wolves to over­come the wiz­ards. Volde­mort has promised him prey in re­turn for his ser­vices. Grey­back spe­cial­izes in chil­dren. . . . Bite them young, he says, and raise them away from their par­ents, raise them to hate nor­mal wiz­ards. Volde­mort has threat­ened to un­leash him up­on peo­ple’s sons and daugh­ters; it is a threat that usu­al­ly pro­duces good re­sults.”

Lupin paused and then said, “It was Grey­back who bit me.” “What?” said Har­ry, as­ton­ished. “When — when you were a kid, you mean?”

“Yes. My fa­ther had of­fend­ed him. I did not know, for a very long time, the iden­ti­ty of the were­wolf who had at­tacked me; I even felt pity for him, think­ing that he had had no con­trol, know­ing by then how it felt to trans­form. But Grey­back is not like that. At the full moon, he po­si­tions him­self close to vic­tims, en­sur­ing that he is near enough to strike. He plans it all. And this is the man Volde­mort is us­ing to mar­shal the were­wolves. I can­not pre­tend that my par­tic­ular brand of rea­soned ar­gu­ment is mak­ing much head­way against Grey­back’s in­sis­tence that we were­wolves de­serve blood, that we ought to re­venge our­selves on nor­mal peo­ple.” “But you are nor­mal!” said Har­ry fierce­ly. “You’ve just got a — a

prob­lem —”

Lupin burst out laugh­ing. “Some­times you re­mind me a lot of James. He called it my ‘fur­ry lit­tle prob­lem in com­pa­ny. Many peo­ple were un­der the im­pres­sion that I owned a bad­ly be­haved

rab­bit.”

He ac­cept­ed a glass of eggnog from Mr. Weasley with a word of thanks, look­ing slight­ly more cheer­ful, Har­ry, mean­while, felt a rush of ex­cite­ment: This last men­tion of his fa­ther had re­mind­ed him that there was some­thing he had been look­ing for­ward to ask­ing Lupin.

“Have you ev­er heard of some­one called the Half­Blood Prince?”

“The Half­Blood what?”

“Prince,” said Har­ry, watch­ing him close­ly for signs of recog­ni­tion.

“There are no Wiz­ard­ing princes,” said Lupin, now smil­ing. “Is this a ti­tle you re think­ing of adopt­ing? I should have thought be­ing ‘the Cho­sen One’ would be enough.”

“It’s noth­ing to do with me!” said Har­ry in­dig­nant­ly. “The Half­Blood Prince is some­one who used to go to Hog­warts, I’ve got his old Po­tions book. He wrote spells all over it, spells he in­vent­ed. One of them was Lev­icor­pus —”

“Oh, that one had a great vogue dur­ing my time at Hog­warts,” said Lupin rem­inis­cent­ly. “There were a few months in my fifth year when you couldn’t move for be­ing hoist­ed in­to the air by your an­kle.”

“My dad used it,” said Har­ry. “I saw him in the Pen­sieve, he used it on Snape.”

He tried to sound ca­su­al, as though this was a throw­away com­ment of no re­al im­por­tance, but he was not sure he had achieved the right ef­fect; Lupins smile was a lit­tle too un­der­stand­ing.

“Yes,” he said, “but he wasn’t the on­ly one. As I say, it was very pop­ular. . . . You know how these spells come and go. , . .”

“But it sounds like it was in­vent­ed while you were at school,” Har­ry per­sist­ed.

“Not nec­es­sar­ily,” said Lupin. “Jinx­es go in and out of fash­ion like ev­ery­thing else.”

He looked in­to Har­ry’s face and then said qui­et­ly, “James was a pure­blood, Har­ry, and I promise you, he nev­er asked us to call him ‘Prince.’”

Aban­don­ing pre­tense, Har­ry said, “And it wasn’t Sir­ius? Or you?”

“Def­inite­ly not.”

“Oh.” Har­ry stared in­to the fire. “I just thought — well, he’s helped me out a lot in Po­tions class­es, the Prince has.”

“How old is this book, Har­ry?”

“I dun­no, I’ve nev­er checked.”

“Well, per­haps that will give you some clue as to when the Prince was at Hog­warts,” said Lupin.

Short­ly af­ter this, Fleur de­cid­ed to im­itate Ce­lesti­na singing “A Caul­dron Full of Hot, Strong Love,” which was tak­en by ev­ery­one, once they had glimpsed Mrs. Weasley’s ex­pres­sion, to be the cue to go to bed. Har­ry and Ron climbed all the way up to Ron’s at­tic bed­room, where a camp bed had been added for Har­ry.

Ron fell asleep al­most im­me­di­ate­ly, but Har­ry delved in­to his trunk and pulled out his copy of Ad­vanced Po­tion­Mak­ing be­fore get­ting in­to bed. There he turned its pages, search­ing, un­til he fi­nal­ly found, at the front of the book, the date that it had been pub­lished. It was near­ly fifty years old. Nei­ther his fa­ther, nor his fa­ther’s friends, had been at Hog­warts fifty years ago. Feel­ing dis­ap­point­ed, Har­ry threw the book back in­to his trunk, turned off the lamp, and rolled over, think­ing of were­wolves and Snape, Stan Shun­pike and the Half­Blood Prince, and fi­nal­ly falling in­to an un­easy sleep full of creep­ing shad­ows and the cries of bit­ten chil­dren. . . .

“She’s got to be jok­ing. . . .”

Har­ry woke with a start to find a bulging stock­ing ly­ing over the end of his bed. He put on his glass­es and looked around; the tiny win­dow was al­most com­plete­ly ob­scured with snow and, in front of it, Ron was sit­ting bolt up­right in bed and ex­am­in­ing what ap­peared to be a thick gold chain.

“What’s chat?” asked Har­ry. ‘

“Its from Laven­der,” said Ron, sound­ing re­volt­ed^ “She earn

hon­est­ly think I’d wear …”

Har­ry looked more close­ly and let out a shout of laugh­ter, Dan

gling from the chain in large gold let­ters were the words:

“My sweet­heart”

“Nice,” he said. “Classy. You should def­inite­ly wear it in front ol Fred and George.”

“If you tell them,” said Ron, shov­ing the neck­lace out of sight un­der his pil­low, “I — I — I’ll —”

“Stut­ter at me?” said Har­ry, grin­ning. “Come on, would I?”

“How could she think I’d like some­thing like that, though?” Ron de­mand­ed of thin air, look­ing rather shocked.

“Well, think back,” said Har­ry. “Have you ev­er let it slip that you’d like to go out in pub­lic with the words ‘My Sweet­heart’ round your neck?”

“Well… we don’t re­al­ly talk much,” said Ron. “It’s main­ly . . .”

“Snog­ging,” said Har­ry.

“Well, yeah,” said Ron. He hes­itat­ed a mo­ment, then said, “Is Hermione re­al­ly go­ing out with McLaggen?”

“I dun­no,” said Har­ry. “They were at Slughorn’s par­ty to­geth­er, but I don’t think it went that well.”

Ron looked slight­ly more cheer­ful as he delved deep­er in­to his stock­ing.

Har­rys presents in­clud­ed a sweater with a large Gold­en Snitch worked on­to the front, hand­knit­ted by Mrs. Weasley, a large box of Weasleys’ Wiz­ard Wheezes prod­ucts from the twins, and a slight­ly damp, moldys­melling pack­age that came with a la­bel read­ing To Mas­ter, From Kreach­er,

Har­ry stared at it. “D’you reck­on this is safe to open?” he asked. “Can’t be any­thing dan­ger­ous, all our mail’s still be­ing searched at the Min­istry,” replied Ron, though he was eye­ing the par­cel sus­pi­cious­ly.

“I didn’t think of giv­ing Kreach­er any­thing. Do peo­ple usu­al­ly give their house­elves Christ­mas presents?” asked Har­ry, prod­ding the par­cel cau­tious­ly.

“Hermione would,” said Ron. “But let’s wait and see what it is be­fore you start feel­ing guilty.”

A mo­ment lat­er, Har­ry had giv­en a loud yell and leapt out of his camp bed; the pack­age con­tained a large num­ber of mag­gots. “Nice,” said Ron, roar­ing with laugh­ter. “Very thought­ful.” “I’d rather have them than that neck­lace,” said Har­ry, which sobered Ron up at once.

Ev­ery­body was wear­ing new sweaters when they all sat down for Christ­mas lunch, ev­ery­one ex­cept Fleur (on whom, it ap­peared, Mrs. Weasley had not want­ed to waste one) and Mrs. Weasley her­self, who was sport­ing a brand­new mid­night blue witch’s hat glit­ter­ing with what looked like tiny star­like di­amonds, and a spec­tac­ular gold­en neck­lace.

“Fred and George gave them to me! Aren’t they beau­ti­ful?” .: “Well, we find we ap­pre­ci­ate you more and more, Mum, now we’re wash­ing our own socks,” said George, wav­ing an airy hand. “Parsnips, Re­mus?”

“Har­ry, you’ve got a mag­got in your hair,” said Gin­ny cheer­ful­ly, lean­ing across the ta­ble to pick it out; Har­ry felt goose bumps erupt up his neck that had noth­ing to do with the mag­got.

“‘Ow ‘or­ri­ble,” said Fleur, with an af­fect­ed lit­tle shud­der.

“Yes, isn’t it?” said Ron. “Gravy, Fleur?”

. In his ea­ger­ness to help her, he knocked the gravy boat fly­ing; Bill waved his wand and the gravy soared up in the air and re­turned meek­ly to the boat.

“You are as bad as zat Tonks,” said Fleur to Ron, when she had fin­ished kiss­ing Bill in thanks. “She is al­ways knock­ing —”

“I in­vit­ed dear Tonks to come along to­day,” said Mrs. Weasley, set­ting down the car­rots with un­nec­es­sary force and glar­ing at Fleur. “But she wouldn’t come. Have you spo­ken to her late­ly, Re­mus?”

“No, I haven’t been in con­tact with any­body very much,” said Lupin. “But Tonks has got her own fam­ily to go to, hasn’t she?”

“Hm­mm,” said Mrs. Weasley. “Maybe. I got the im­pres­sion she was plan­ning to spend Christ­mas alone, ac­tu­al­ly.”

She gave Lupin an an­noyed look, as though it was all his fault she was get­ting Fleur for a daugh­terin­law in­stead of Tonks, but Har­ry, glanc­ing across at Fleur, who was now feed­ing Bill bits of turkey off her own fork, thought that Mrs. Weasley was fight­ing a lon­glost bat­tle. He was, how­ev­er, re­mind­ed of a ques­tion he had with re­gard to Tonks, and who bet­ter to ask than Lupin, the man who knew all about Pa­tronus­es?

“Tonks’s Pa­tronus has changed its form,” he told him. “Snape said so any­way. I didn’t know that could hap­pen. Why would your Pa­tronus change?”

Lupin took his time chew­ing his turkey and sw­al­low­ing be­fore say­ing slow­ly, “Some­times … a great shock … an emo­tion­al up­heaval …”

“It looked big, and it had four legs,” said Har­ry, struck by a sud­den thought and low­er­ing his voice. “Hey … it couldn’t be — ?”

“Arthur!” said Mrs. Weasley sud­den­ly. She had risen from her chair; her hand was pressed over her heart and she was star­ing out of the kitchen win­dow. “Arthur — it’s Per­cy!”

“What?”

Mr. Weasley looked around. Ev­ery­body looked quick­ly at the win­dow; Gin­ny stood up for a bet­ter look. There, sure enough, was Per­cy Weasley, strid­ing across the snowy yard, his horn­rimmed glass­es glint­ing in the sun­light. He was not, how­ev­er, alone.

“Arthur, he’s — he’s with the Min­is­ter!”

And sure enough, the man Har­ry had seen in the Dai­ly Prophet was fol­low­ing along in Per­cy’s wake, limp­ing slight­ly, his mane of gray­ing hair and his black cloak flecked with snow. Be­fore any of , them could say any­thing, be­fore Mr. and Mrs. Weasley could do : more than ex­change stunned looks, the back door opened and there stood Per­cy.

There was a mo­ment’s painful si­lence. Then Per­cy said rather stiffly, “Mer­ry Christ­mas, Moth­er.”

“Oh, Per­cy!” said Mrs. Weasley, and she threw her­self in­to his arms.

Ru­fus Scrim­geour paused in the door­way, lean­ing on his walk­ing stick and smil­ing as he ob­served this af­fect­ing scene.

“You must for­give this in­tru­sion,” he said, when Mrs. Weasley looked around at him, beam­ing and wip­ing her eyes. “Per­cy and I were in the vicin­ity — work­ing, you know — and he couldn’t re­sist drop­ping in and see­ing you all.”

But Per­cy showed no sign of want­ing to greet any of the rest of the fam­ily. He stood, pok­er­straight and awk­ward­look­ing, and stared over ev­ery­body else’s heads. Mr. Weasley, Fred, and George were all ob­serv­ing him, stony­faced.

“Please, come in, sit down, Min­is­ter!” flut­tered Mrs. Weasley, straight­en­ing her hat. Have a lit­tle purkey, or some tood­ing. … 1 ‘. mean —”

“No, no, my dear Mol­ly,” said Scrim­geour. Har­ry guessed that he had checked her name with Per­cy be­fore they en­tered the house. “I don’t want to in­trude, wouldn’t be here at all if Per­cy hadn’t want­ed to see you all so bad­ly. . . .”

“Oh, Perce!” said Mrs. Weasley tear­ful­ly, reach­ing up to kiss him.

“. , . We’ve on­ly looked in for five min­utes, so I’ll have a stroll around the yard while you catch up with Per­cy. No, no, I as­sure you I don’t want to butt in! Well, if any­body cared to show me your charm­ing gar­den . . . Ah, that young man’s fin­ished, why doesn’t he take a stroll with me?”

The at­mo­sphere around the ta­ble changed per­cep­ti­bly. Ev­ery­body looked from Scrim­geour to Har­ry. No­body seemed to find Scrim­geour’s pre­tense that he did not know Har­ry’s name con­vinc­ing, or find it nat­ural that he should be cho­sen to ac­com­pa­ny the Min­is­ter around the gar­den when Gin­ny, Fleur, and George al­so had clean plates.

“Yeah, all right,” said Har­ry in­to the si­lence.

He was not fooled; for all Scrim­geour’s talk that they had just been in the area, that Per­cy want­ed to look up his fam­ily, this must be the re­al rea­son that they had come, so that Scrim­geour could speak to Har­ry alone.

“It’s fine,” he said qui­et­ly, as he passed Lupin, who had half risen from his chair. “Fine,” he added, as Mr. Weasley opened his mouth to speak.

“Won­der­ful!” said Scrim­geour, stand­ing back to let Har­ry pass

through the door ahead of him. “We’ll just take a turn around the gar­den, and Per­cy and I’ll be off. Car­ry on, ev­ery­one!”

Har­ry walked across the yard to­ward the Weasleys’ over­grown, snow­cov­ered gar­den, Scrim­geour limp­ing slight­ly at his side. He had, Har­ry knew, been Head of the Au­ror of­fice; he looked tough and bat­tlescarred, very dif­fer­ent from port­ly Fudge in his bowler hat.

“Charm­ing,” said Scrim­geour, stop­ping at the gar­den fence and look­ing out over the snowy lawn and the in­dis­tin­guish­able plants. “Charm­ing.”

Har­ry said noth­ing. He could tell that Scrim­geour was watch­ing him.

“I’ve want­ed to meet you for a very long time,” said Scrim­geour, af­ter a few mo­ments. “Did you know that?”

“No,” said Har­ry truth­ful­ly. ¦!.

“Oh yes, for a very long time. But Dum­ble­dore has been very pro­tec­tive of you,” said Scrim­geour. “Nat­ural, of course, nat­ural, af­ter what you’ve been through. . . . Es­pe­cial­ly what hap­pened at : the Min­istry …”:

He wait­ed for Har­ry to say some­thing, but Har­ry did not oblige, : so he went on, “I have been hop­ing for an oc­ca­sion to talk to you ev­er since I gained of­fice, but Dum­ble­dore has — most un­der­stand­ably, as I say — pre­vent­ed this.”

Still, Har­ry said noth­ing, wait­ing.

“The ru­mors that have flown around!” said Scrim­geour. “Well, of course, we both know how these sto­ries get dis­tort­ed … all these whis­pers of a prophe­cy . . . of you be­ing ‘the Cho­sen One’. . .”

They were get­ting near it now, Har­ry thought, the rea­son Scrim­geour was here.

“I as­sume that Dum­ble­dore has dis­cussed these mat­ters with you?”,

Har­ry de­lib­er­at­ed, won­der­ing whether he ought to lie or not. He looked at the lit­tle gnome prints all around the flowerbeds, ami the scuffedup patch that marked the spot where Fred had caught the gnome now wear­ing the tu­tu at the top of the Christ­mas tree. Fi­nal­ly, he de­cid­ed on the truth … or a bit of it.

“Yeah, we’ve dis­cussed it.”

“Have you, have you . . .” said Scrim­geour. Har­ry could see, out of the cor­ner of his eye, Scrim­geour squint­ing at him, so he pre­tend­ed to be very in­ter­est­ed in a gnome that had just poked its head out from un­der­neath a frozen rho­do­den­dron. “And what has Dum­ble­dore told you, Har­ry?”

“Sor­ry, but that’s be­tween us,” said Har­ry. He kept his voice as pleas­ant as he could, and Scrim­geour’s tone, too, was light and friend­ly as he said, “Oh, of course, if it’s a ques­tion of con­fi­dences, I wouldn’t want you to di­vulge . . . no, no … and in any case, does it re­al­ly mat­ter whether you are ‘the Cho­sen One’ or not?”

Har­ry had to mull that one over for a few sec­onds be­fore re­spond­ing. “I don’t re­al­ly know what you mean, Min­is­ter.”

“Well, of course, to you it will mat­ter enor­mous­ly,” said Scrim­geour with a laugh. “But to the Wiz­ard­ing com­mu­ni­ty at large . . . it’s all per­cep­tion, isn’t it? It’s what peo­ple be­lieve that’s im­por­tant.”

Har­ry said noth­ing. He thought he saw, dim­ly, where they were head­ing, but he was not go­ing to help Scrim­geour get there. The gnome un­der the rho­do­den­dron was now dig­ging for worms at its roots, and Har­ry kept his eyes fixed up­on it.

“Peo­ple be­lieve you are ‘the Cho­sen One,’ you see,” said Scrim­geour. “They think you quite the hero — which, of course, you arc, Har­ry, cho­sen or not! How many times have you faced He­Who­Must­Not­Be­Named now? Well, any­way,” he pressed on, with­out wait­ing for a re­ply, “the point is, you are a sym­bol of hope lor many, Har­ry. The idea that there is some­body out there who might be able, who might even be des­tined, to de­stroy He­Who­Must­Not­Be­Named — well, nat­ural­ly, it gives peo­ple a lift. And I can’t help but feel that, once you re­al­ize this, you might con­sid­er it, well, al­most a du­ty, to stand along­side the Min­istry, and give ev­ery­one a boost.”

The gnome had just man­aged to get hold of a worm. It was now tug­ging very hard on it, try­ing to get it out of the frozen ground. Har­ry was silent so long that Scrim­geour said, look­ing from Har­ry to the gnome, “Fun­ny lit­tle chaps, aren’t they? But what say you, Har­ry?”

“I don’t ex­act­ly un­der­stand what you want,” said Har­ry slow­ly. ‘”Stand along­side the Min­istry’ . . . What does that mean?”

“Oh, well, noth­ing at all on­er­ous, I as­sure you,” said Scrim­geour. “If you were to be seen pop­ping in and out of the Min­istry from time to time, for in­stance, that would give the right im­pres­sion. And of course, while you were there, you would have am­ple : op­por­tu­ni­ty to speak to Gawain Ro­bards, my suc­ces­sor as Head of the Au­ror of­fice. Do­lores Um­bridge has told me that you cher­ish an am­bi­tion to be­come an Au­ror. Well, that could be ar­ranged very eas­ily. …”

Har­ry felt anger bub­bling in the pit of his stom­ach: So Do­lores Um­bridge was still at the Min­istry, was she?

“So ba­si­cal­ly,” he said, as though he just want­ed to clar­ify a few points, “you’d like to give the im­pres­sion that I’m work­ing for the Min­istry?”

“It would give ev­ery­one a lift to think you were more in­volved, Har­ry,” said Scrim­geour, sound­ing re­lieved that Har­ry had cot­toned on so quick­ly. “‘The Cho­sen One,’ you know. . . It’s all about giv­ing peo­ple hope, the feel­ing that ex­cit­ing things are hap­pen­ing. …”

“But if I keep run­ning in and out of the Min­istry,” said Har­ry, still en­deav­or­ing to keep his voice friend­ly, “won’t that seem as though I ap­prove of what the Min­istry’s up to?”

“Well,” said Scrim­geour, frown­ing slight­ly, “well, yes, that’s part­ly why we’d like —”

“No, I don’t think that’ll work,” said Har­ry pleas­ant­ly. “You see, I don’t like some of the things the Min­istry’s do­ing. Lock­ing up Stan Shun­pike, for in­stance.”

Scrim­geour did not speak for a mo­ment but his ex­pres­sion hard­ened in­stant­ly. “I would not ex­pect you to un­der­stand,” he said, and he was not as suc­cess­ful at keep­ing anger out of his voice as Har­ry had been. “These are dan­ger­ous times, and cer­tain mea­sures need to be tak­en. You are six­teen years old —”

“Dum­ble­dore’s a lot old­er than six­teen, and he doesn’t think Stan should be in Azk­aban ei­ther,” said Har­ry. “You’re mak­ing Stan a scape­goat, just like you want to make me a mas­cot.”

They looked at each oth­er, long and hard. Fi­nal­ly Scrim­geour said, with no pre­tense at warmth, “I see. You pre­fer — like your hero, Dum­ble­dore — to dis­as­so­ci­ate your­self from the Min­istry?” “I don’t want to be used,” said Har­ry.

“Some would say it’s your du­ty to be used by the Min­istry!” “Yeah, and oth­ers might say its your du­ty to check that peo­ple re­al­ly are Death Eaters be­fore you chuck them in prison,” said Har­ry, his tem­per ris­ing now. “You’re do­ing what Bar­ty Crouch

did. You nev­er get it right, you peo­ple, do you? Ei­ther we’ve got Fudge, pre­tend­ing ev­ery­thing’s love­ly while peo­ple get mur­dered right un­der his nose, or we’ve got you, chuck­ing the wrong peo­ple in­to jail and try­ing to pre­tend you’ve got ‘the Cho­sen One’ work­ing for you!” ‘ i

“So you’re not ‘the Cho­sen One’?” said Scrim­geour. ‘

“I thought you said it didn’t mat­ter ei­ther way?” said Har­ry, with a bit­ter laugh. “Not to you any­way.”

“I shouldn’t have said that,” said Scrim­geour quick­ly. “It was tact­less —”

“No, it was hon­est,” said Har­ry. “One of the on­ly hon­est things you’ve said to me. You don’t care whether I live or die, but you do care that I help you con­vince ev­ery­one you’re win­ning the war against Volde­mort. I haven’t for­got­ten, Min­is­ter….”

He raised his right fist. There, shin­ing white on the back of his cold hand, were the scars which Do­lores Um­bridge had forced him to carve in­to his own flesh: I must not tell lies.

“I don’t re­mem­ber you rush­ing to my de­fense when I was try­ing to tell ev­ery­one Volde­mort was back. The Min­istry wasn’t so keen to be pals last year.”

They stood in si­lence as icy as the ground be­neath their feet. The gnome had fi­nal­ly man­aged to ex­tri­cate his worm and was now suck­ing on it hap­pi­ly, lean­ing against the bot­tom­most branch­es of the rho­do­den­dron bush.

“What is Dum­ble­dore up to?” said Scrim­geour brusque­ly. “Where does he go when he is ab­sent from Hog­warts?”

“No idea,” said Har­ry.

“And you wouldn’t tell me if you knew,” said Scrim­geour, “would you?”

“No, 1 wouldn’t,” said Har­ry.

“Well, then, I shall have to see whether I can’t find out by oth­er means.”

“You can try,” said Har­ry in­dif­fer­ent­ly. “But you seem clev­er­er than Fudge, so I’d have thought you’d have learned from his mis­takes. He tried in­ter­fer­ing at Hog­warts. You might have no­ticed he’s not Min­is­ter any­more, but Dum­ble­dore’s still head­mas­ter. I’d leave Dum­ble­dore alone, if I were you.”

There was a long pause.

“Well, it is clear to me that he has done a very good job on you,” said Scrim­geour, his eyes cold and hard be­hind his wirerimmed glass­es, “Dum­ble­dore’s man through and through, aren’t you, Pot­ter?”

“Yeah, I am,” said Har­ry. “Glad we straight­ened that out.”

And turn­ing his back on the Min­is­ter of Mag­ic, he strode back to­ward the house.
