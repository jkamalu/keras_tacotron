Chapter 29: The Pheonix Lament


C ‘mere, Har­ry …”

“No.”

“Yeh can’ stay here, Har­ry. … Come on, now….” “No.”

He did not want to leave Dum­ble­dores side, he did not want to move any­where. Ha­grid’s hand on his shoul­der was trem­bling. Then an­oth­er voice said, “Har­ry, come on.”

A much small­er and warmer hand had en­closed his and was pulling him up­ward. He obeyed its pres­sure with­out re­al­ly think­ing about it. On­ly as he walked blind­ly back through the crowd did he re­al­ize, from a trace of flow­ery scent on the air, that it was Gin­ny who was lead­ing him back in­to the cas­tle. In­com­pre­hen­si­ble voic­es bat­tered him, sobs and shouts and wails stabbed the night, but Har­ry and Gin­ny walked on, back up the steps in­to the en­trance hall. Faces swam on the edges of Har­ry’s vi­sion, peo­ple were peer­ing at him, whis­per­ing, won­der­ing, and Gryffind­or ru­bies glis­tened on the floor like drops of blood as they made their way to­ward the mar­ble stair­case.

“We’re go­ing to the hos­pi­tal wing,” said Gin­ny.

“I’m not hurt,” said Har­ry. !

“It’s McG­ona­galls or­ders,” said Gin­ny. “Ev­ery­one’s up there, Ron and Hermione and Lupin and ev­ery­one -“

Fear stirred in Har­ry’s chest again: He had for­got­ten the in­ert fig­ures he had left be­hind.

“Gin­ny, who else is dead?”

“Don’t wor­ry, none of us.”

“But the Dark Mark - Mal­foy said he stepped over a body -“

“He stepped over Bill, but its all right, he’s alive.”

There was some­thing in her voice, how­ev­er, that Har­ry knew bod­ed ill.

“Are you sure?”

“Of course I’m sure . . . he’s a - a bit of a mess, that’s all. Grey­back at­tacked him. Madam Pom­frey says he won’t - won’t look the same any­more. . . .”

Gin­ny’s voice trem­bled a lit­tle.

“We don’t re­al­ly know what the af­ter­ef­fects will be - I mean, Grey­back be­ing a were­wolf, but not trans­formed at the time.”

“But the oth­ers . . . There were oth­er bod­ies on the ground. . . .”

“Neville and Pro­fes­sor Flitwick are both hurt, but Madam Pom­frey says they’ll be all right. And a Death Eater’s dead, he got hit by a Killing Curse that huge blond one was fir­ing off ev­ery­where - Har­ry, if we hadn’t had your Fe­lix po­tion, I think we’d all have been killed, but ev­ery­thing seemed to just miss us -“

They had reached the hos­pi­tal wing. Push­ing open the doors, Har­ry saw Neville ly­ing, ap­par­ent­ly asleep, in a bed near the door. Ron, Hermione, Lu­na, Tonks, and Lupin were gath­ered around an­oth­er bed near the far end of the ward. At the sound of the doors open­ing, they all looked up. Hermione ran to Har­ry and hugged him; Lupin moved for­ward too, look­ing anx­ious.

“Are you all right, Har­ry?”

“I’m fine…. How’s Bill?”

No­body an­swered. Har­ry looked over Hermione’s shoul­der and saw an un­rec­og­niz­able face ly­ing on Bill’s pil­low, so bad­ly slashed and ripped that he looked grotesque. Madam Pom­frey was dab­bing at his wounds with some harshsmelling green oint­ment. Har­ry re­mem­bered how Snape had mend­ed Mal­foy’s Sec­tum­sem­pra wounds so eas­ily with his wand.

“Can’t you fix them with a charm or some­thing?” he asked the ma­tron.

“No charm will work on these,” said Madam Pom­frey. “I’ve tried ev­ery­thing I know, but there is no cure for were­wolf bites.”

“But he wasn’t bit­ten at the full moon,” said Ron, who was gaz­ing down in­to his broth­er’s face as though he could some­how force him to mend just by star­ing. “Grey­back hadn’t trans­formed, so sure­ly Bill won’t be a - a re­al - ?” :

He looked un­cer­tain­ly at Lupin.

“No, I don’t think that Bill will be a true were­wolf,” said Lupin, “but that does not mean that there won’t be some con­tam­ina­tion. Those are cursed wounds. They are un­like­ly ev­er to heal ful­ly, and - and Bill might have some wolfish char­ac­ter­is­tics from now on.”

“Dum­ble­dore might know some­thing that’d work, though,” Ron said. “Where is he? Bill fought those ma­ni­acs on Dum­ble­dore’s or­ders, Dum­ble­dore owes him, he can’t leave him in this state -“

“Ron - Dum­ble­dores dead,” said Gin­ny.

“No!” Lupin looked wild­ly from Gin­ny to Har­ry, as though hop­ing the lat­ter might con­tra­dict her, but when Har­ry did nor, Lupin col­lapsed in­to a chair be­side Bill’s bed, his hands over his face. Har­ry had nev­er seen Lupin lose con­trol be­fore; he felt as though he was in­trud­ing up­on some­thing pri­vate, in­de­cent. He turned away and caught Ron’s eye in­stead, ex­chang­ing in si­lence a look that con­firmed what Gin­ny had said.

“How did he die?” whis­pered Tonks. “How did it hap­pen?”

“Snape killed him,” said Har­ry. “I was there, I saw it. We ar­rived back on the As­tron­omy Tow­er be­cause that’s where the Mark was. . . . Dum­ble­dore was ill, he was weak, but I think he re­al­ized it was a trap when we heard foot­steps run­ning up the stairs. He im­mo­bi­lized me, I couldn’t do any­thing, I was un­der the In­vis­ibil­ity Cloak - and then Mal­foy came through the door and dis­armed him -“

Hermione clapped her hands to her mouth and Ron groaned. Lu­na’s mouth trem­bled.

“- more Death Eaters ar­rived - and then Snape - and Snape did it. The Ava­da Ke­davra.” Har­ry couldn’t go on.

Madam Pom­frey burst in­to tears. No­body paid her any at­ten­tion ex­cept Gin­ny, who whis­pered, “Shh! Lis­ten!”

Gulp­ing, Madam Pom­frey pressed her fin­gers to her mouth, her eyes wide. Some­where out in the dark­ness, a phoenix was singing in a way Har­ry had nev­er heard be­fore: a strick­en lament of ter­ri­ble beau­ty. And Har­ry felt, as he had felt about phoenix song be­fore, that the mu­sic was in­side him, not with­out: It was his own grief turned mag­ical­ly to song that echoed across the grounds and through the cas­tle win­dows.

How long they all stood there, lis­ten­ing, he did not know, nor why it seemed to ease their pain a lit­tle to lis­ten to the sound of their mourn­ing, but it felt like a long time lat­er that the hos­pi­tal door opened again and Pro­fes­sor McG­ona­gall en­tered the ward. Like all the rest, she bore marks of the re­cent bat­tle: There were grazes on her face and her robes were ripped.

“Mol­ly and Arthur are on their way,” she said, and the spell of the mu­sic was bro­ken: Ev­ery­one roused them­selves as though com­ing out of trances, turn­ing again to look at Bill, or else to rub their own eye­st shake their heads. “Har­ry, what hap­pened? Ac­cord­ing to Ha­grid you were with Pro­fes­sor Dum­ble­dore when he - when it hap­pened. He says Pro­fes­sor Snape was in­volved in some -” “Snape killed Dum­ble­dore,” said Har­ry.

She stared at him for a mo­ment, then swayed alarm­ing­ly; Madam Pom­frey, who seemed to have pulled her­self to­geth­er, ran for­ward, con­jur­ing a chair from thin air, which she pushed un­der McG­ona­gall.

“Snape,” re­peat­ed McG­ona­gall faint­ly, falling in­to the chair. “We all won­dered . . . but he trust­ed . . . al­ways . . . Snape… I can’t be­lieve it. …”

“Snape was a high­ly ac­com­plished Oc­clu­mens,” said Lupin, his voice un­char­ac­ter­is­ti­cal­ly harsh. “We al­ways knew that.”

“But Dum­ble­dore swore he was on our side!” whis­pered Tonks. “I al­ways thought Dum­ble­dore must know some­thing about Snape that we didn’t. …” .

“He al­ways hint­ed that he had an iron­clad rea­son for trust­ing Snape,” mut­tered Pro­fes­sor McG­ona­gall, now dab­bing at the cor­ners of her leak­ing eyes with a tar­tanedged hand­ker­chief. “I mean . . . with Snapes his­to­ry … of course peo­ple were bound to won­der. . . but Dum­ble­dore told me ex­plic­it­ly that Snape’s re­pen­tance was ab­so­lute­ly gen­uine—–Wouldn’t hear a word against him!”

“I’d love to know what Snape told him to con­vince him,” said Tonks.

“I know,” said Har­ry, and they all turned to look at him. “Snape passed Volde­mort the in­for­ma­tion that made Volde­mort hunt down my mum and dad. Then Snape told Dum­ble­dore he hadn’t re­al­ized what he was do­ing, he was re­al­ly sor­ry he’d done it, sor­ry that they were dead.”

They all stared at him.

“And Dum­ble­dore be­lieved that?” said Lupin in­cred­ulous­ly. “Dum­ble­dore be­lieved Snape was sor­ry James was dead? Snape hat­ed James. . . .”

“And he didn’t think my moth­er was worth a damn ei­ther,” said Har­ry, “be­cause she was Mug­gle­born… ‘Mud­blood,’ he called her. …”

No­body asked how Har­ry knew this. All of them seemed to be lost in hor­ri­fied shock, try­ing to di­gest the mon­strous truth of what had hap­pened.

“This is all my fault,” said Pro­fes­sor McG­ona­gall sud­den­ly. She looked dis­ori­ent­ed, twist­ing her wet hand­ker­chief in her hands. “My fault. I sent Fil­ius to fetch Snape tonight, I ac­tu­al­ly sent for him to come and help us! If I hadn’t alert­ed Snape to what was go­ing on, he might nev­er have joined forces with the Death Eaters. I don’t think he knew they were there be­fore Fil­ius told him, I don’t think he knew they were com­ing.”

“It isn’t your fault, Min­er­va,” said Lupin firm­ly. “We all want­ed more help, we were glad to think Snape was on his way….”

“So when he ar­rived at the fight, he joined in on the Death Eaters’ side?” asked Har­ry, who want­ed ev­ery de­tail of Snape’s du­plic­ity and in­famy, fever­ish­ly col­lect­ing more rea­sons to hate him, to swear vengeance.

“I don’t know ex­act­ly how it hap­pened,” said Pro­fes­sor McG­ona­gall dis­tract­ed­ly. “It’s all so con­fus­ing. . . . Dum­ble­dore had told us that he would be leav­ing the school for a few hours and that we were to pa­trol the cor­ri­dors just in case . . . Re­mus, Bill, and Nympha­do­ra were to join us … and so we pa­trolled. All seemed qui­et. Ev­ery se­cret pas­sage­way out of the school was cov­ered. We knew no­body could fly in. There were pow­er­ful en­chant­ments on ev­ery en­trance in­to the cas­tle. I still don’t know how the Death Eaters can pos­si­bly have en­tered. . . .”

“I do,” said Har­ry, and he ex­plained, briefly, about the pair of Van­ish­ing Cab­in­ets and the mag­ical path­way they formed. “So they got in through the Room of Re­quire­ment.”

Al­most against his will he glanced from Ron to Hermione, both of whom looked dev­as­tat­ed.

“I messed up, Har­ry,” said Ron bleak­ly. “We did like you told us: We checked the Ma­raud­er’s Map and we couldn’t see Mal­foy on it, so we thought he must be in the Room of Re­quire­ment, so me, Gin­ny, and Neville went to keep watch on it… but Mal­foy got past us.”

“He came out of the room about an hour af­ter we start­ed keep­ing watch,” said Gin­ny. “He was on his own, clutch­ing that aw­ful shriv­eled arm -“

“His Hand of Glo­ry,” said Ron. “Gives light on­ly to the hold­er, re­mem­ber?”

“Any­way,” Gin­ny went on, “he must have been check­ing whether the coast was clear to let the Death Eaters out, be­cause the mo­ment he saw us he threw some­thing in­to the air and it all went pitch­black -“

“- Pe­ru­vian In­stant Dark­ness Pow­der,” said Ron bit­ter­ly. “Fred and George’s. I’m go­ing to be hav­ing a word with them about who they let buy their prod­ucts.”

“We tried ev­ery­thing, Lu­mos, In­cen­dio,” said Gin­ny. “Noth­ing would pen­etrate the dark­ness; all we could do was grope our way out of the cor­ri­dor again, and mean­while we could hear peo­ple rush­ing past us. Ob­vi­ous­ly Mal­foy could see be­cause of that hand thing and was guid­ing them, but we didn’t dare use any curs­es or any­thing in case we hit each oth­er, and by the time we’d reached a cor­ri­dor that was light, they’d gone.”

“Luck­ily,” said Lupin hoarse­ly, “Ron, Gin­ny, and Neville ran in­to us al­most im­me­di­ate­ly and told us what had hap­pened. We found the Death Eaters min­utes lat­er, head­ing in the di­rec­tion of the As­tron­omy Tow­er. Mal­foy ob­vi­ous­ly hadn’t ex­pect­ed more peo­ple to be on the watch; he seemed to have ex­haust­ed his sup­ply of Dark­ness Pow­der, at any rate. A fight broke out, they scat­tered and we gave chase. One of them, Gib­bon, broke away and head­ed up the tow­er stairs -“

“To set off the Mark?” asked Har­ry.

“He must have done, yes, they must have ar­ranged that be­fore they left the Room of Re­quire­ment,” said Lupin. “But I don’t think Gib­bon liked the idea of wait­ing up there alone for Dum­ble­dore, be­cause he came run­ning back down­stairs to re­join the fight and was hit by a Killing Curse that just missed me.”

“So if Ron was watch­ing the Room of Re­quire­ment with Gin­ny and Neville,” said Har­ry, turn­ing to Hermione, “were you - ?”

“Out­side Snape’s of­fice, yes,” whis­pered Hermione, her eyes sparkling with tears, “with Lu­na. We hung around for ages out­side it and noth­ing hap­pened. . . . We didn’t know what was go­ing on up­stairs, Ron had tak­en the map—–It was near­ly mid­night when Pro­fes­sor Flitwick came sprint­ing down in­to the dun­geons. He was shout­ing about Death Eaters in the cas­tle, I don’t think he re­al­ly reg­is­tered that Lu­na and I were there at all, he just burst his way in­to Snape’s of­fice and we heard him say­ing that Snape had to go back with him and help and then we heard a loud thump and Snape came hurtling out of his room and he saw us and - and -” “What?” Har­ry urged her.

“I was so stupid, Har­ry!” said Hermione in a high­pitched whis­per. “He said Pro­fes­sor Flitwick had col­lapsed and that we should go and take care of him while he - while he went to help fight the Death Eaters -” She cov­ered her face in shame and con­tin­ued to talk in­to her fin­gers, so that her voice was muf­fled. “We went in­to his of­fice to see if we could help Pro­fes­sor Flitwick and found him un­con­scious on the floor. . . and oh, it’s so ob­vi­ous now, Snape must have Stu­pe­fied Flitwick, but we didn’t re­al­ize, Har­ry, we didn’t re­al­ize, we just let Snape go!”

“It’s not your fault,” said Lupin firm­ly. “Hermione, had you not obeyed Snape and got out of the way, he prob­ably would have killed you and Lu­na.”

“So then he came up­stairs,” said Har­ry, who was watch­ing Snape run­ning up the mar­ble stair­case in his mind’s eye, his black robes bil­low­ing be­hind him as ev­er, pulling his wand from un­der his cloak as he as­cend­ed, “and he found the place where you were all fight­ing. …”

“We were in trou­ble, we were los­ing,” said Tonks in a low voice. “Gib­bon was down, but the rest of the Death Eaters seemed ready to fight to the death. Neville had been hurt, Bill had been sav­aged by Grey­back… It was all dark . . . curs­es fly­ing ev­ery­where . . . The Mal­foy boy had van­ished, he must have slipped past, up the stairs . . . then more of them ran af­ter him, but one of them blocked the stair be­hind them with some kind of curse. . . . Neville ran at it and got thrown up in­to the air -“

“None of us could break through,” said Ron, “and that mas­sive Death Eater was still fir­ing off jinx­es all over the place, they were bounc­ing off the walls and bare­ly miss­ing us. . . .”

“And then Snape was there,” said Tonks, “and then he wasn’t -“

“I saw him run­ning to­ward us, but that huge Death Eaters jinx just missed me right af­ter­ward and I ducked and lost track of things,” said Gin­ny.

“I saw him run straight through the cursed bar­ri­er as though it wasn’t there,” said Lupin. “I tried to fol­low him, but was thrown back just like Neville. . . .”

“He must have known a spell we didn’t,” whis­pered McG­ona­gall. “Af­ter all - he was the De­fense Against the Dark Arts teach­er. … I just as­sumed that he was in a hur­ry to chase af­ter the Death Eaters who’d es­caped up to the tow­er. …”

“He was,” said Har­ry sav­age­ly, “but to help them, not to stop them . . . and I’ll bet you had to have a Dark Mark to get through that bar­ri­er - so what hap­pened when he came back down?”

“Well, the big Death Eater had just fired off a hex that caused half the ceil­ing to fall in, and al­so broke the curse block­ing the stairs,” said Lupin. “We all ran for­ward - those of us who were still stand­ing any­way - and then Snape and the boy emerged out of the dust - ob­vi­ous­ly, none of us at­tacked them -“

“We just let them pass,” said Tonks in a hol­low voice. “We thought they were be­ing chased by the Death Eaters - and next thing, the oth­er Death Eaters and Grey­back were back and we were fight­ing again - I thought I heard Snape shout some­thing, but I don’t know what -“

“He shout­ed, ‘It’s over,’” said Har­ry. “He’d done what he’d meant to do.”

They all fell silent. Fawkes’s lament was still echo­ing over the dark grounds out­side. As the mu­sic re­ver­ber­at­ed up­on the air, un­bid­den, un­wel­come thoughts slunk in­to Har­ry’s mind. . . . Had they tak­en Dum­ble­dore’s body from the foot of the tow­er yet? What would hap­pen to it next? Where would it rest? He clenched his fists tighdy in his pock­ets. He could feel the small cold lump of the fake Hor­crux against the knuck­les of his right hand.

The doors of the hos­pi­tal wing burst open, mak­ing them all jump: Mr. and Mrs. Weasley were strid­ing up the ward, Fleur just be­hind them, her beau­ti­ful face ter­ri­fied.

“Mol­ly - Arthur -” said Pro­fes­sor McG­ona­gall, jump­ing up and hur­ry­ing to greet them. “I am so sor­ry -“

“Bill,” whis­pered Mrs. Weasley, dart­ing past Pro­fes­sor McG­ona­gall as she caught sight of Bill’s man­gled face. “Oh, Bill!”

Lupin and Tonks had got up hasti­ly and re­treat­ed so that Mr. and Mrs. Weasley could get near­er to the bed. Mrs. Weasley bent over her son and pressed her lips to his bloody fore­head.

“You said Grey­back at­tacked him?” Mr. Weasley asked Pro­fes­sor McG­ona­gall dis­tract­ed­ly. “But he hadn’t trans­formed? So what does that mean? What will hap­pen to Bill?”

“We don’t yet know,” said Pro­fes­sor McG­ona­gall, look­ing help­less­ly at Lupin.

“There will prob­ably be some con­tam­ina­tion, Arthur,” .said Lupin. “It is an odd case, pos­si­bly unique. . . . We don’t know what his be­hav­ior might be like when he awak­ens. . . .”

Mrs. Weasley took the nastys­melling oint­ment from Madam Pom­frey and be­gan dab­bing at Bill’s wounds.

“And Dum­ble­dore …” said Mr. Weasley. “Min­er­va, is it true … Is he re­al­ly. . . ?”

As Pro­fes­sor McG­ona­gall nod­ded, Har­ry felt Gin­ny move be­side him and looked at her. Her slight­ly nar­rowed eyes were fixed up­on Fleur, who was gaz­ing down at Bill with a frozen ex­pres­sion on her face.

“Dum­ble­dore gone,” whis­pered Mr. Weasley, but Mrs. Weasley had eyes on­ly for her el­dest son; she be­gan to sob, tears falling on­to Bill’s mu­ti­lat­ed face.

“Of course, it doesn’t mat­ter how he looks. . . . It’s not rre­al­ly im­por­tant. . . but he was a very hand­some lit­tle bboy . . . al­ways very hand­some . . . and he was ggo­ing to be mar­ried!”

“And what do you mean by zat?” said Fleur sud­den­ly and loud­ly. “What do you mean, ‘ he was go­ing to be mar­ried?’”

Mrs. Weasley raised her tearstained face, look­ing star­tled. “Well -on­ly that-“

“You theenk Bill will not wish to mar­ry me any­more?” de­mand­ed Fleur. “You theenk, be­cause of these bites, he will not love me?”

“No, that’s not what I -“

“Be­cause ‘e will!” said Fleur, draw­ing her­self up to her full height and throw­ing back her long mane of sil­ver hair. “It would take more zan a were­wolf to stop Bill lov­ing me!”

“Well, yes, I’m sure,” said Mrs. Weasley, “but I thought per­haps - giv­en how - how he -“

“You thought I would not weesh to mar­ry him? Or per’aps, you hoped?” said Fleur, her nos­trils flar­ing. “What do I care how he looks? I am good­look­ing enough for both of us, I theenk! All these scars show is zat my hus­band is brave! And I shall do zat!” she added fierce­ly, push­ing Mrs. Weasley aside and snatch­ing the oint­ment from her.

Mrs. Weasley fell back against her hus­band and watched Fleur mop­ping up Bill’s wounds with a most cu­ri­ous ex­pres­sion up­on her face. No­body said any­thing; Har­ry did not dare move. Like ev­ery­body else, he was wait­ing for the ex­plo­sion.

“Our GreatAun­tie Muriel,” said Mrs. Weasley af­ter a long pause, “has a very beau­ti­ful tiara - gob­lin­made - which I am sure I could per­suade her to lend you for the wed­ding. She is very fond of Bill, you know, and it would look love­ly with your hair.”

“Thank you,” said Fleur stiffly. “I am sure zat will be love­ly.”

And then, Har­ry did not quite see how it hap­pened, both , wom­en were cry­ing and hug­ging each oth­er. Com­plete­ly be­wil­dered, won­der­ing whether the world had gone mad, he turned around: Ron looked as stunned as he felt and Gin­ny and Hermione were ex­chang­ing star­tled looks.

“You see!” said a strained voice. Tonks was glar­ing at Lupin. “She still wants to mar­ry him, even though he’s been bit­ten! She doesn’t care!

“It’s dif­fer­ent,” said Lupin, bare­ly mov­ing his lips and look­ing sud­den­ly tense. “Bill will not be a full were­wolf. The cas­es are com­plete­ly -“

“But I don’t care ei­ther, I don’t care!” said Tonks, seiz­ing the front of Lupin’s robes and shak­ing them. “I’ve told you a mil­li­on times. . . .”

And the mean­ing of Tonks’s Pa­tronus and her mousec­ol­ored hair, and the rea­son she had come run­ning to find Dum­ble­dore when she had heard a ru­mor some­one had been at­tacked by Grey­back, all sud­den­ly be­came clear to Har­ry; it had not been Si­nus that Tonks had fall­en in love with af­ter all.

“And I’ve told you a mil­li­on times,” said Lupin, re­fus­ing to meet her eyes, star­ing at the floor, “that I am too old for you, too poor . . . too dan­ger­ous. . . .”

“I’ve said all along you’re tak­ing a ridicu­lous line on this, Re­mus,” said Mrs. Weasley over Fleur’s shoul­der as she pat­ted her on the back.

“I am not be­ing ridicu­lous,” said Lupin stea­di­ly. “Tonks de­serves some­body young and whole.”

“But she wants you,” said Mr. Weasley, with a small smile. “And af­ter all, Re­mus, young and whole men do not nec­es­sar­ily re­main so.”

He ges­tured sad­ly at his son, ly­ing be­tween them.

“This is… not the mo­ment to dis­cuss it,” said Lupin, avoid­ing ev­ery­body’s eyes as he looked around dis­tract­ed­ly. “Dum­ble­dore is dead. …”

“Dum­ble­dore would have been hap­pi­er than any­body to think that there was a lit­tle more love in the world,” said Pro­fes­sor McG­ona­gall curt­ly, just as the hos­pi­tal doors opened again and Ha­grid walked in.

The lit­tle of his face that was not ob­scured by hair or beard was soak­ing and swollen; he was shak­ing with tears, a vast, spot­ted hand­ker­chief in his hand.

“I’ve . . . I’ve done it, Pro­fes­sor,” he choked. “Mmoved him. Pro­fes­sor Sprout’s got the kids back in bed. Pro­fes­sor Flitwick’s lyin down, but he says he’ll be all righ’ in a jiffy, an’ Pro­fes­sor Slughorn says the Min­istry’s bin in­formed.”

“Thank you, Ha­grid,” said Pro­fes­sor McG­ona­gall, stand­ing up at once and turn­ing to look at the group around Bill’s bed. “I shall have to see the Min­istry when they get here. Ha­grid, please tell the Heads of Hous­es - Slughorn can rep­re­sent Slytherin - that I want to see them in my of­fice forth­with. I would like you to join us too.”

As Ha­grid nod­ded, turned, and shuf­fled out of the room again, she looked down at Har­ry. “Be­fore I meet them I would like a quick word with you, Har­ry. If you’ll come with me. …”

Har­ry stood up, mur­mured “See you in a bit” to Ron, Hermione, and Gin­ny, and fol­lowed Pro­fes­sor McG­ona­gall back down the ward. The cor­ri­dors out­side were de­sert­ed and the on­ly sound was the dis­tant phoenix song. It was sev­er­al min­utes be­fore Har­ry be­came aware that they were not head­ing for Pro­fes­sor McG­ona­gall’s of­fice, but for Dum­ble­dore’s, and an­oth­er few sec­onds be­fore he re­al­ized that of course, she had been deputy head­mis­tress, . . . Ap­par­ent­ly she was now head­mis­tress … so the room be­hind the gar­goyle was now hers.

In si­lence they as­cend­ed the mov­ing spi­ral stair­case and en­tered the cir­cu­lar of­fice. He did not know what he had ex­pect­ed: that the room would be draped in black, per­haps, or even that Dum­ble­dore’s body might be ly­ing there. In fact, it looked al­most ex­act­ly as it had done when he and Dum­ble­dore had left it mere hours pre­vi­ous­ly: the sil­ver in­stru­ments whirring and puff­ing on their spin­dle legged ta­bles, Gryffind­or’s sword in its glass case gleam­ing in the moon­light, the Sort­ing Hat on a shelf be­hind the desk, the Fawkes’s perch stood emp­ty, he was still cry­ing his lament to the grounds. And a new por­trait had joined the ranks of the dead head­mas­ters and head­mis­tress­es of Hog­warts: Dum­ble­dore was slum­ber­ing in a gold­en frame over the desk, his half­moon spec­ta­cle perched up­on his crooked nose, look­ing peace­ful and un­trou­bled.

Af­ter glanc­ing once at this por­trait, Pro­fes­sor McG­ona­gall made an odd move­ment as though steel­ing her­self, then round­ed the’ desk to look at Har­ry, her face taut and lined.

“Har­ry,” she said, “I would like to know what you and Pro­fes­sor Dum­ble­dore were do­ing this evening when you left the school.”

“I can’t tell you that, Pro­fes­sor,” said Har­ry. He had ex­pect­ed the ques­tion and had his an­swer ready. It had been here, in this very room, that Dum­ble­dore had told him that he was to con­fide the con­tents of their lessons to no­body but Ron and Hermione.

“Har­ry, it might be im­por­tant,” said Pro­fes­sor McG­ona­gall.

“It is,” said Har­ry, “very, but he didn’t want me to tell any­one.”

Pro­fes­sor McG­ona­gall glared at him. “Pot­ter” - Har­ry reg­is­tered the re­newed use of his sur­name - “in the light of Pro­fes­sor Dum­ble­dore’s death, I think you must see that the sit­ua­tion has changed some­what -“

“I don’t think so,” said Har­ry, shrug­ging. “Pro­fes­sor Dum­ble­dore nev­er told me to stop fol­low­ing his or­ders if he died.” But -

“There’s one thing you should know be­fore the Min­istry gets here, though. Madam Ros­mer­ta’s un­der the Im­perius Curse, she was help­ing Mal­foy and the Death Eaters, that’s how the neck­lace and the poi­soned mead -“

“Ros­mer­ta?” said Pro­fes­sor McG­ona­gall in­cred­ulous­ly, but be­fore she could go on, there was a knock on the door be­hind them and Pro­fes­sors Sprout, Flitwick, and Slughorn traipsed in­to the room, fol­lowed by Ha­grid, who was still weep­ing co­pi­ous­ly, his huge frame trem­bling with grief.

“Snape!” ejac­ulat­ed Slughorn, who looked the most shak­en, pale and sweat­ing. “Snape! I taught him! I thought I knew him!”

But be­fore any of them could re­spond to this, a sharp voice spoke from high on the wall: A sal­low­faced wiz­ard with a short black fringe had just walked back in­to his emp­ty can­vas. “Min­er­va, the Min­is­ter will be here with­in sec­onds, he has just Dis­ap­pa­rat­ed from the Min­istry.”

“Thank you, Ev­er­ard,” said Pro­fes­sor McG­ona­gall, and she turned quick­ly to her teach­ers.

“I want to talk about what hap­pens to Hog­warts be­fore he gets here,” she said quick­ly. “Per­son­al­ly, I am not con­vinced that the school should re­open next year. The death of the head­mas­ter at the hands of one of our col­leagues is a ter­ri­ble stain up­on Hog­warts’s his­to­ry. It is hor­ri­ble.”

“I am sure Dum­ble­dore would have want­ed the school to re­main open,” said Pro­fes­sor Sprout. “I feel that if a sin­gle pupil wants to come, then the school ought to re­main open for that pupil.”

“But will we have a sin­gle pupil af­ter this?” said Slughorn, now dab­bing his sweat­ing brow with a silken hand­ker­chief. “Par­ents will want to keep their chil­dren at home and I can’t say I blame them. Per­son­al­ly, I don’t think we’re in more dan­ger at Hog­warts than we are any­where else, but you can’t ex­pect moth­ers to think like that. They’ll want to keep their fam­ilies to­geth­er, it’s on­ly nat­ural.”

“I agree,” said Pro­fes­sor McG­ona­gall. “And in any case, it is not true to say that Dum­ble­dore nev­er en­vis­aged a sit­ua­tion in which Hog­warts might close. When the Cham­ber of Se­crets re­opened he con­sid­ered the clo­sure of the school - and I must say that Pro­fes­sor Dum­ble­dore’s mur­der is more dis­turb­ing to me than the idea of Slytherin’s mon­ster liv­ing un­de­tect­ed in the bow­els of the cas­tle. . . .”

“We must con­sult the gov­er­nors,” said Pro­fes­sor Flitwick in his squeaky lit­tle voice; he had a large bruise on his fore­head but seemed oth­er­wise un­scathed by his col­lapse in Snape’s of­fice. “We must fol­low the es­tab­lished pro­ce­dures. A de­ci­sion should not be made hasti­ly.”

“Ha­grid, you haven’t said any­thing,” said Pro­fes­sor McG­ona­gall. “What are your views, ought Hog­warts to re­main open?”

Ha­grid, who had been weep­ing silent­ly in­to his large, spot­ted hand­ker­chief through­out this con­ver­sa­tion, now raised puffy red eyes and croaked, “I dun­no, Pro­fes­sor . . . that’s fer the Heads of House an the head­mis­tress ter de­cide …”

“Pro­fes­sor Dum­ble­dore al­ways val­ued your views,” said Pro­fes­sor McG­ona­gall kind­ly, “and so do I.”

“Well, I’m stayin,” said Ha­grid, fat tears still leak­ing out of the cor­ners of his eyes and trick­ling down in­to his tan­gled beard. “It’s me home, it’s bin me home since I was thir­teen. An’ if there’s kids who wan’ me ter teach ‘em, I’ll do it. But… I dun­no … Hog­warts with­out Dum­ble­dore .. .” He gulped and dis­ap­peared be­hind his hand­ker­chief once more, and there was si­lence.

“Very well,” said Pro­fes­sor McG­ona­gall, glanc­ing out of the win­dow at the grounds, check­ing to see whether the Min­is­ter was yet ap­proach­ing, “then I must agree with Fil­ius that the right thing to do is to con­sult the gov­er­nors, who will make the fi­nal de­ci­sion.

“Now, as to get­ting stu­dents home . . . there is an ar­gu­ment for do­ing it soon­er rather than lat­er. We could ar­range for the Hog­warts Ex­press to come to­mor­row if nec­es­sary -“

“What about Dum­ble­dore’s fu­ner­al?” said Har­ry, speak­ing at last.

“Well. . .” said Pro­fes­sor McG­ona­gall, los­ing a lit­tle of her brisk­ness as her voice shook. “I - I know that it was Dum­ble­dore’s wish to be laid to rest here, at Hog­warts -“

“Then that’s what’ll hap­pen, isn’t it?” said Har­ry fierce­ly.

“If the Min­istry thinks it ap­pro­pri­ate,” said Pro­fes­sor McG­ona­gall. “No oth­er head­mas­ter or head­mis­tress has ev­er been -“

“No oth­er head­mas­ter or head­mis­tress ev­er gave more to this school,” growled Ha­grid.

“Hog­warts should be Dum­ble­dore’s fi­nal rest­ing place,” said Pro­fes­sor Flitwick.

“Ab­so­lute­ly,” said Pro­fes­sor Sprout.

“And in that case,” said Har­ry, “you shouldn’t send the stu­dents home un­til the jfu­ner­al’s over. They’ll want to say -“

The last word caught in his throat, but Pro­fes­sor Sprout com­plet­ed the sen­tence for him. “Good­bye.”

“Well said,” squeaked Pro­fes­sor Flitwick. “Well said in­deed! Our stu­dents should pay trib­ute, it is fit­ting. We can ar­range trans­port home af­ter­ward.”

“Sec­ond­ed,” barked Pro­fes­sor Sprout. ]

“I sup­pose … yes .. .” said Slughorn in a rather ag­itat­ed voice, while Ha­grid let out a stran­gled sob of as­sent.

“He’s com­ing,” said Pro­fes­sor McG­ona­gall sud­den­ly, gaz­ing down in­to the grounds. “The Min­is­ter . . . and by the looks of it. he’s brought a del­ega­tion . . .”

“Can I leave, Pro­fes­sor?” said Har­ry at once.

He had no de­sire at all to see, or be in­ter­ro­gat­ed by, Ru­fus Scrim­geour tonight.

“You may,” said Pro­fes­sor McG­ona­gall. “And quick­ly.”

She strode to­ward the door and held it open for him. He sped down the spi­ral stair­case and off along the de­sert­ed cor­ri­dor; hehad left his In­vis­ibil­ity Cloak at the top of the As­tron­omy Tow­er, but it did not mat­ter; there was no­body in the cor­ri­dors to see him pass, not even Filch, Mrs. Nor­ris, or Peeves. He did not meet an­oth­er soul un­til he turned in­to the pas­sage lead­ing to the Gryffind­or com­mon room.

“Is it true?” whis­pered the Fat La­dy as he ap­proached her. “It is re­al­ly true? Dum­ble­dore - dead?”

“Yes,” said Har­ry.

She let out a wail and, with­out wait­ing for the pass­word, swung for­ward to ad­mit him.

As Har­ry had sus­pect­ed it would be, the com­mon room was jam­packed. The room fell silent as he climbed through the por­trait hole. He saw Dean and Sea­mus sit­ting in a group near­by: This meant that the dor­mi­to­ry must be emp­ty, or near­ly so. With­out speak­ing to any­body, with­out mak­ing eye con­tact at all, Har­ry walked straight across the room and through the door to the boys’ dor­mi­to­ries.

As he had hoped, Ron was wait­ing for him, still ful­ly dressed, sit­ting on his bed. Har­ry sat down on his own four­poster and for a mo­ment, they sim­ply stared at each oth­er.

“They’re talk­ing about clos­ing the school,” said Har­ry.

“Lupin said they would,” said Ron.

There was a pause.

“So?” said Ron in a very low voice, as though he thought the fur­ni­ture might be lis­ten­ing in. “Did you find one? Did you get it? A - a Hor­crux?”

Har­ry shook his head. All that had tak­en place around that black lake seemed like an old night­mare now; had it re­al­ly hap­pened, and on­ly hours ago?

“You didn’t get it?” said Ron, look­ing crest­fall­en. “It wasn’t there?”

“No,” said Har­ry. “Some­one had al­ready tak­en it and left a fake in its place.”

“Al­ready tak­en - ?”

Word­less­ly, Har­ry pulled the fake lock­et from his pock­et, opened it, and passed it to Ron. The full sto­ry could wait. … It did not mat­ter tonight. . . noth­ing mat­tered ex­cept the end, the end of their point­less ad­ven­ture, the end of Dum­ble­dore’s life. . . .

“R.A.B.,” whis­pered Ron, “but who was that?”

“Dun­no,” said Har­ry, ly­ing back on his bed ful­ly clothed and star­ing blankly up­wards. He felt no cu­rios­ity at all about R.A.B.: He doubt­ed that he would ev­er feel cu­ri­ous again. As he lay there, he be­came aware sud­den­ly that the grounds were silent. Fawkes had stopped singing. And he knew, with­out know­ing how he knew it, that ilie phoenix had gone, had left Hog­warts for good, just as Dum­ble­dore had left the school, had left the world . . . had left Har­ry.
