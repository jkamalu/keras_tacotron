Chapter 6: Draco’s Detour


Har­ry re­mained with­in the con­fines of the Bur­row’s gar­den over the next few weeks. He spent most of his days play­ing twoa­side Quid­ditch in the Weasleys’ or­chard (he and Hermione against Ron and Gin­ny; Hermione was dread­ful and Gin­ny good, so they were rea­son­ably well matched) and his evenings eat­ing triple help­in­gs of ev­ery­thing Mrs. Weasley put in front of him.

It would have been a hap­py, peace­ful hol­iday had it not been for the stones of dis­ap­pear­an­ces, odd ac­ci­dents, even of deaths now ap­pear­ing al­most dai­ly in the Prophet. Some­times Bill and Mr. Weasley brought home news be­fore it even reached the pa­per. To Mrs. Weasley’s dis­plea­sure, Har­ry’s six­teenth birth­day cel­ebra­tions were marred by gris­ly tid­in­gs brought to the par­ty by Re­mus Lupin, who was look­ing gaunt and grim, his brown hair streaked lib­er­al­ly with gray, his clothes more ragged and patched than ev­er.

“There have been an­oth­er cou­ple of de­men­tor at­tacks,” he an­nounced, as Mrs. Weasley passed him a large slice of birth­day cake. “And they’ve found Ig­or Karkaroff’s body in a shack up north. The Dark Mark had been set over it… well, frankly, I’m sur­prised he stayed alive for even a year af­ter de­sert­ing the Death Eaters; Sir­ius’s broth­er, Reg­ulus, on­ly man­aged a few days as far as I can re­mem­ber.”

“Yes, well,” said Mrs. Weasley, frown­ing, “per­haps we should talk about some­thing diff…”

“Did you hear about Flo­re­an Fortes­cue, Re­mus?” asked Bill, who was be­ing plied with wine by Fleur. “The man who ran…”

“Is the ice­cream place in Di­agon Al­ley?” Har­ry in­ter­rupt­ed, with an un­pleas­ant, hol­low sen­sa­tion in the pit of his stom­ach. “He used to give me free ice creams. What’s hap­pened to him?”

“Dragged off, by the look of his place.”

“Why?” asked Ron, while Mrs. Weasley point­ed­ly glared at Bill.

“Who knows? He must’ve up­set them some­how. He was a good man, Flo­re­an.”

“Talk­ing of Di­agon Al­ley,” said Mr. Weasley, “looks like Ol­li­van­der’s gone too.”

“The wand­mak­er?” said Gin­ny, look­ing star­tled.

“That’s the one. Shop’s emp­ty. No sign of a strug­gle. No one knows whether he left vol­un­tar­ily or was kid­napped.”

“But what’ll peo­ple do for wands?”

“They’ll make do with oth­er mak­ers,” said Lupin. “But Ol­li­van­der was the best, and if the oth­er side have got him it’s not so good for us.”

The day af­ter this rather gloomy birth­day tea, their let­ters and book­lists ar­rived from Hog­warts. Har­ry’s in­clud­ed a sur­prise: he had been made Quid­ditch Cap­tain.

“That gives you equal sta­tus with pre­fects!” cried Hermione hap­pi­ly. “You can use our spe­cial bath­room now and ev­ery­thing!”

“Wow, I re­mem­ber when Char­lie wore one of these,” said Ron, ex­am­in­ing the badge with glee. “Har­ry, this is so cool, you’re my Cap­tain… if you let me back on the team, I sup­pose, ha ha…”

“Well, I don’t sup­pose we can put off a trip to Di­agon Al­ley much longer now you’ve got these,” sighed Mrs. Weasley, look­ing down Ron…s book­list. “We’ll go on Sat­ur­day as long as your fa­ther doesn’t have to go in­to work again. I’m not go­ing there with­out him.”

“Mum, d’you hon­est­ly think YouKnowWho’s go­ing to be hid­ing be­hind a book­shelf in Flour­ish and Blotts?” snig­gered Ron.

“Fortes­cue and Ol­li­van­der went on hol­iday, did they?” said Mrs. Weasley, fir­ing up at once. “If you think se­cu­ri­ty’s a laugh­ing mat­ter you can stay be­hind and I’ll get your things my­self…”

“No, I wan­na come, I want to see Fred and George’s shop!” said Ron hasti­ly.

“Then you just buck up your ideas, young man, be­fore I de­cide you’re too im­ma­ture to come with us!” said Mrs. Weasley an­gri­ly, snatch­ing up her clock, all nine hands of which were still point­ing at “mor­tal per­il,” and bal­anc­ing it on top of a pile of just­laun­dered tow­els. “And that goes for re­turn­ing to Hog­warts as well!”

Ron turned to stare in­cred­ulous­ly at Har­ry as his moth­er hoist­ed the laun­dry bas­ket and the tee­ter­ing clock in­to her arms and stormed out of the room.

“Blimey… you can’t even make a joke round here any­more…”

But Ron was care­ful not to be flip­pant about Volde­mort over the next few days. Sat­ur­day dawned with­out any more out­bursts from Mrs. Weasley, though she seemed very tense at break­fast. Bill, who would be stay­ing at home with Fleur (much to Hermione and Gin­ny’s plea­sure), passed a full mon­ey bag across the ta­ble to Har­ry.

“Where’s mine?” de­mand­ed Ron at once, his eyes wide.

“That’s al­ready Har­ry’s, id­iot,” said Bill. “I got it out of your vault for you, Har­ry, be­cause it’s tak­ing about five hours for the pub­lic to get to their gold at the mo­ment, the gob­lins have tight­ened se­cu­ri­ty so much. Two days ago Arkie Philpott had a Pro­bity Probe stuck up his… Well, trust me, this way’s eas­ier.”

“Thanks, Bill,” said Har­ry, pock­et­ing his gold.

“E is al­ways so thought­ful,” purred Fleur ador­ing­ly, stroking Bill’s nose. Gin­ny mimed vom­it­ing in­to her ce­re­al be­hind Fleur. Har­ry choked over his corn­flakes, and Ron thumped him on the back.

It was an over­cast, murky day. One of the spe­cial Min­istry of Mag­ic cars, in which Har­ry had rid­den once be­fore, was await­ing them in the front yard when they emerged from the house, pulling on their cloaks.

“It’s good Dad can get us these again,” said Ron ap­pre­cia­tive­ly, stretch­ing lux­uri­ous­ly as the car moved smooth­ly away from the Bur­row, Bill and Fleur wav­ing from the kitchen win­dow. He, Har­ry, Hermione, and Gin­ny were all sit­ting in roomy com­fort in the wide back­seat.

“Don’t get used to it, it’s on­ly be­cause of Har­ry,” said Mr. Weasley over his shoul­der. He and Mrs. Weasley were in front with the Min­istry driv­er; the front pas­sen­ger seat had oblig­ing­ly stretched in­to what re­sem­bled a twoseater so­fa. “He’s been giv­en top­grade se­cu­ri­ty sta­tus. And we’ll be join­ing up with ad­di­tion­al se­cu­ri­ty at the Leaky Caul­dron too.”

Har­ry said noth­ing; he did not much fan­cy do­ing his shop­ping while sur­round­ed by a bat­tal­ion of Au­rors. He had stowed his In­vis­ibil­ity Cloak in his back­pack and felt that, if that was good enough for Dum­ble­dore, it ought to be good enough for the Min­istry, though now he came to think of it, he was not sure the Min­istry knew about his cloak.

“Here you are, then,” said the driv­er, a sur­pris­ing­ly short while lat­er, speak­ing for the first time as he slowed in Char­ing Cross Road and stopped out­side the Leaky Caul­dron. “I’m to wait for you, any idea how long you’ll be?”

“A cou­ple of hours, I ex­pect,” said Mr. Weasley. “Ah, good, he’s here!”

Har­ry im­itat­ed Mr. Weasley and peered through the win­dow; his heart leapt. There were no Au­rors wait­ing out­side the inn, but in­stead the gi­gan­tic, black­beard­ed form of Rubeus Ha­grid, the Hog­warts game­keep­er, wear­ing a long beaver­skin coat, beam­ing at the sight of Har­ry’s face and obliv­ious to the star­tled stares of pass­ing Mug­gles.

“Har­ry!” he boomed, sweep­ing Har­ry in­to a bonecrush­ing hug the mo­ment Har­ry had stepped out of the car. “Buck­beak… With­er­wings, I mean… yeh should see him, Har­ry, he’s so hap­py ter be back in the open air…”

“Glad he’s pleased,” said Har­ry, grin­ning as he mas­saged his ribs. “We didn’t know ’se­cu­ri­ty’ meant you!”

“I know, jus’ like old times, in­nit? See, the Min­istry want­ed ter send a bunch o’ Au­rors, but Dum­ble­dore said I’d do,” said Ha­grid proud­ly, throw­ing out his chest and tuck­ing his thumbs in­to his pock­ets. “Lets get goin’ then… af­ter yeh, Mol­ly, Arthur…”

The Leaky Caul­dron was, for the first time in Har­ry’s mem­ory, com­plete­ly emp­ty. On­ly Tom the land­lord, wiz­ened and tooth­less, re­mained of the old crowd. He looked up hope­ful­ly as they en­tered, but be­fore he could speak, Ha­grid said im­por­tant­ly, “Jus’ passin’ through to­day, Tom, sure yeh un­der­stand, Hog­warts busi­ness, yeh know.”

Tom nod­ded gloo­mi­ly and re­turned to wip­ing glass­es; Har­ry, Hermione, Ha­grid, and the Weasleys walked through the bar and out in­to the chilly lit­tle court­yard at the back where the dust­bins stood. Ha­grid raised his pink um­brel­la and rapped a cer­tain brick in the wall, which opened at once to form an arch­way on­to a wind­ing cob­bled street. They stepped through the en­trance and paused, look­ing around.

Di­agon Al­ley had changed. The col­or­ful, glit­ter­ing win­dow dis­plays of spell­books, po­tion in­gre­di­ents, and caul­drons were lost to view, hid­den be­hind the large Min­istry of Mag­ic posters that had been past­ed over them. Most of these somber pur­ple posters car­ried blownup ver­sions of the se­cu­ri­ty ad­vice on the Min­istry pam­phlets that had been sent out over the sum­mer, but oth­ers bore mov­ing blackand­white pho­tographs of Death Eaters known to be on the loose. Bel­la­trix Lestrange was sneer­ing from the front of the near­est apothe­cary. A few win­dows were board­ed up, in­clud­ing those of Flo­re­an Fortes­cue’s Ice Cream Par­lor. On the oth­er hand, a num­ber of shab­by­look­ing stalls had sprung up along the street. The near­est one, which had been erect­ed out­side Flour­ish and Blotts, un­der a striped, stained awning, had a card­board sign pinned to its front:

AMULETS

Ef­fec­tive Against Were­wolves, De­men­tors, and In­feri!

A seedy­look­ing lit­tle wiz­ard was rat­tling arm­fuls of sil­ver sym­bols on chains at passers­by.

“One for your lit­tle girl, madam?” he called at Mrs. Weasley as they passed, leer­ing at Gin­ny. “Pro­tect her pret­ty neck?”

“If I were on du­ty…” said Mr. Weasley, glar­ing an­gri­ly at the amulet sell­er.

“Yes, but don’t go ar­rest­ing any­one now, dear, we’re in a hur­ry,” said Mrs. Weasley, ner­vous­ly con­sult­ing a list. “I think we’d bet­ter do Madam Malkin’s first, Hermione wants new dress robes, and Ron’s show­ing much too much an­kle in his school robes, and you must need new ones too, Har­ry, you’ve grown so much… come on, ev­ery­one…”

“Mol­ly, it doesn’t make sense for all of us to go to Madam Malkin’s,” said Mr. Weasley. “Why don’t those three go with Ha­grid, and we can go to Flour­ish and Blotts and get ev­ery­one’s school­books?”

“I don’t know,” said Mrs. Weasley anx­ious­ly, clear­ly torn be­tween a de­sire to fin­ish the shop­ping quick­ly and the wish to stick to­geth­er in a pack. “Ha­grid, do you think…- ?”

“Don’t fret, they’ll be fine with me, Mol­ly,” said Ha­grid sooth­ing­ly, wav­ing an airy hand the size of a dust­bin lid. Mrs. Weasley did not look en­tire­ly con­vinced, but al­lowed the sep­ara­tion, scur­ry­ing off to­ward Flour­ish and Blotts with her hus­band and Gin­ny while Har­ry, Ron, Hermione, and Ha­grid set off for Madam Malkin’s.

Har­ry no­ticed that many of the peo­ple who passed them had the same har­ried, anx­ious look as Mrs. Weasley, and that no­body was stop­ping to talk any­more; the shop­pers stayed to­geth­er in their own tight­ly knit groups, mov­ing in­tent­ly about their busi­ness. No­body seemed to be shop­ping alone.

“Migh’ be a bit of a squeeze in there with all of us,” said Ha­grid, stop­ping out­side Madam Malkin’s and bend­ing down to peer through the win­dow. “I’ll stand guard out­side, all right?”

So Har­ry, Ron, and Hermione en­tered the lit­tle shop to­geth­er. It ap­peared, at first glance, to be emp­ty, but no soon­er had the door swung shut be­hind them than they heard a fa­mil­iar voice is­su­ing from be­hind a rack of dress robes in span­gled green and blue.

“… not a child, in case you haven’t no­ticed, Moth­er. I am per­fect­ly ca­pa­ble of do­ing my shop­ping alone.”

There was a cluck­ing noise and a voice Har­ry rec­og­nized as that of Madam Malkin, the own­er, said, “Now, dear, your moth­er’s quite right, none of us is sup­posed to go wan­der­ing around on our own any­more, it’s noth­ing to do with be­ing a child…”

“Watch where you’re stick­ing that pin, will you!”

A teenage boy with a pale, point­ed face and white­blond hair ap­peared from be­hind the rack, wear­ing a hand­some set of dark green robes that glit­tered with pins around the hem and the edges of the sleeves. He strode to the mir­ror and ex­am­in­ed him­self; it was a few mo­ments be­fore he no­ticed Har­ry, Ron, and Hermione re­flect­ed over his shoul­der. His light gray eyes nar­rowed.

“If you’re won­der­ing what the smell is, Moth­er, a Mud­blood just walked in,” said Dra­co Mal­foy.

“I don’t think there’s any need for lan­guage like that!” said Madam Malkin, scur­ry­ing out from be­hind the clothes rack hold­ing a tape mea­sure and a wand. “And I don’t want wands drawn in my shop ei­ther!” she added hasti­ly, for a glance to­ward the door had shown her Har­ry and Ron both stand­ing there with their wands out and point­ing at Mal­foy. Hermione, who was stand­ing slight­ly be­hind them, whis­pered, “No, don’t, hon­est­ly, it’s not worth it. “

“Yeah, like you’d dare do mag­ic out of school,” sneered Mal­foy. “Who blacked your eye, Granger? I want to send them flow­ers.”

“That’s quite enough!” said Madam Malkin sharply, look­ing over her shoul­der for sup­port. “Madam, please!”

Nar­cis­sa Mal­foy strolled out from be­hind the clothes rack.

“Put those away,” she said cold­ly to Har­ry and Ron. “If you at­tack my son again, I shall en­sure that it is the last thing you ev­er do.”

“Re­al­ly?” said Har­ry, tak­ing a step for­ward and gaz­ing in­to the smooth­ly ar­ro­gant face that, for all its pal­lor, still re­sem­bled her sis­ter’s. He was as tall as she was now. “Go­ing to get a few Death Eater pals to do us in, are you?”

Madam Malkin squealed and clutched at her heart.

“Re­al­ly, you shouldn’t ac­cuse… dan­ger­ous thing to say… wands away, please!”

But Har­ry did not low­er his wand. Nar­cis­sa Mal­foy smiled un­pleas­ant­ly.

“I see that be­ing Dum­ble­dore’s fa­vorite has giv­en you a false sense of se­cu­ri­ty, Har­ry Pot­ter. But Dum­ble­dore won’t al­ways be there to pro­tect you.”

Har­ry looked mock­ing­ly all around the shop. “Wow… look at that… he’s not here now! So why not have a go? They might be able to find you a dou­ble cell in Azk­aban with your los­er of a hus­band!”

Mal­foy made an an­gry move­ment to­ward Har­ry, but stum­bled over his over­long robe. Ron laughed loud­ly.

“Don’t you dare talk to my moth­er like that, Pot­ter!” Mal­foy snarled.

“It’s all right, Dra­co,” said Nar­cis­sa, re­strain­ing him with her thin white fin­gers up­on his shoul­der. “I ex­pect Pot­ter will be re­unit­ed with dear Sir­ius be­fore I am re­unit­ed with Lu­cius.”

Har­ry raised his wand high­er.

“Har­ry, no!” moaned Hermione, grab­bing his arm and at­tempt­ing to push it down by his side. “Think… You mustn’t… You’ll be in such trou­ble…”

Madam Malkin dithered for a mo­ment on the spot, then seemed to de­cide to act as though noth­ing was hap­pen­ing in the hope that it wouldn’t. She bent to­ward Mal­foy, who was still glar­ing at Har­ry.

“I think this left sleeve could come up a lit­tle bit more, dear, let me just…”

“Ouch!” bel­lowed Mal­foy, slap­ping her hand away. “Watch where you’re putting your pins, wom­an! Moth­er, I don’t think I want these any­more.”

He pulled the robes over his head and threw them on­to the floor at Madam Malkin’s feet.

“You’re right, Dra­co,” said Nar­cis­sa, with a con­temp­tu­ous glance at Hermione, “now I know the kind of scum that shops here… We’ll do bet­ter at Twil­fitt and Tat­ting’s.”

And with that, the pair of them strode out of the shop, Mal­foy tak­ing care to bang as hard as he could in­to Ron on the way out.

“Well, re­al­ly? said Madam Malkin, snatch­ing up the fall­en robes and mov­ing the tip of her wand over them like a vac­uum clean­er, so that it re­moved all the dust.

She was dis­tract­ed all through the fit­ting of Ron’s and Har­ry’s new robes, tried to sell Hermione wiz­ard’s dress robes in­stead of witch’s, and when she fi­nal­ly bowed them out of the shop it was with an air of be­ing glad to see the back of them.

“Got ev’ry­thing?” asked Ha­grid bright­ly when they reap­peared at his side.

“Just about,” said Har­ry. “Did you see the Mal­foys?”

“Yeah,” said Ha­grid, un­con­cerned. “Bu they wouldn… dare make trou­ble in the mid­dle o’ Di­agon Al­ley, Har­ry. Don’ wor­ry abou1 them.”

Har­ry, Ron, and Hermione ex­changed looks, but be­fore they could dis­abuse Ha­grid of this com­fort­able no­tion, Mr. and Mrs. Weasley and Gin­ny ap­peared, all clutch­ing heavy pack­ages of books.

“Ev­ery­one all right?” said Mrs. Weasley. “Got your robes? Right then, we can pop in at the Apothe­cary and Eey­lops on the way to Fred and George’s… stick close, now…”

Nei­ther Har­ry nor Ron bought any in­gre­di­ents at the Apothe­cary, see­ing that they were no longer study­ing Po­tions, but both bought large box­es of owl nuts for Hed­wig and Pig­wid­geon at Eey­lops Owl Em­po­ri­um. Then, with Mrs. Weasley check­ing her watch ev­ery minute or so, they head­ed far­ther along the street in search of Weasleys’ Wiz­ard Wheezes, the joke shop run by Fred and George.

“We re­al­ly haven’t got too long,” Mrs. Weasley said. “So we’ll just have a quick look around and then back to the car. We must be close, that’s num­ber nine­tyt­wo… nine­ty­four…”

“Whoa,”said Ron, stop­ping in his tracks.

Set against the dull, poster­muf­fled shop Fronts around them, Fred and Georges win­dows hit the eye like a fire­work dis­play. Ca­su­al passers­by were look­ing back over their shoul­ders at the win­dows, and a few rather stunned­look­ing peo­ple had ac­tu­al­ly come to a halt, trans­fixed. The left­hand win­dow was daz­zling­ly full of an as­sort­ment of goods that re­volved, popped, flashed, bounced, and shrieked; Har­rys eyes be­gan to wa­ter just look­ing at it. The right­hand win­dow was cov­ered with a gi­gan­tic poster, pur­ple like those of the Min­istry, but em­bla­zoned with flash­ing yel­low let­ters:

WHY ARE YOU WOR­RY­ING ABOUT YOUKNOWWHO? YOU SHOULD BE WOR­RY­ING ABOUT UN­OPOO– THE CON­STI­PA­TION SEN­SA­TION THAT’S GRIP­PING THE NA­TION!

Har­ry start­ed to laugh. He heard a weak sort of moan be­side him and looked around to see Mrs. Weasley gaz­ing, dumb­found­ed, at the poster. Her lips moved silent­ly, mouthing the name “UN­oPoo.”

“They’ll be mur­dered in their beds!” she whis­pered.

“No they won’t!” said Ron, who, like Har­ry, was laugh­ing. “This is bril­liant!”

And he and Har­ry led the way in­to the shop. It was packed with cus­tomers; Har­ry could not get near the shelves. He stared around, look­ing up at the box­es piled to the ceil­ing: Here were the Skiv­ing Snack­box­es that the twins had per­fect­ed dur­ing their last, un­fin­ished year at Hog­warts; Har­ry no­ticed that the Nose­bleed Nougat was most pop­ular, with on­ly one bat­tered box left on the shelf. There were bins full of trick wands, the cheap­est mere­ly turn­ing in­to rub­ber chick­ens or pairs of briefs when waved, the most ex­pen­sive beat­ing the un­wary us­er around the head and neck, and box­es of quills, which came in Self­Ink­ing, SpellCheck­ing, and Smar­tAn­swer va­ri­eties. A space cleared in the crowd, and Har­ry pushed his way to­ward the counter, where a gag­gle of de­light­ed tenyearolds was watch­ing a tiny lit­tle wood­en man slow­ly as­cend­ing the steps to a re­al set of gal­lows, both perched on a box that read: Reusable hang­man - spell it or he’ll swing!

“Patent­ed Day­dream Charms”

Hermione had man­aged to squeeze through to a large dis­play near the counter and was read­ing the in­for­ma­tion on the back of a box bear­ing a high­ly col­ored pic­ture of a hand­some youth and a swoon­ing girl who were stand­ing on the deck of a pi­rate ship.

“One sim­ple in­can­ta­tion and you will en­ter a topqual­ity, high­ly re­al­is­tic, thir­tyminute day­dream, easy to fit in­to the av­er­age school les­son and vir­tu­al­ly un­de­tectable (side ef­fects in­clude va­cant ex­pres­sion and mi­nor drool­ing). Not for sale to un­der­six­teens. You know,” said Hermione, look­ing up at Har­ry, “that re­al­ly is ex­traor­di­nary mag­ic!”

“For that, Hermione,” said a voice be­hind them, “you can have one for free.”

A beam­ing Fred stood be­fore them, wear­ing a set of ma­gen­ta robes that clashed mag­nif­icent­ly with his flam­ing hair.

“How are you, Har­ry?” They shook hands. “And what’s hap­pened to your eye, Hermione?”

Your punch­ing tele­scope,” she said rue­ful­ly.

“Oh blimey, I for­got about those,” said Fred. “Here…”

He pulled a tub out of his pock­et and hand­ed it to her; she un­screwed it gin­ger­ly to re­veal a thick yel­low paste.

“Just dab it on, that bruise’ll be gone with­in the hour,” said Fred. “We had to find a de­cent bruise re­mover. We’re test­ing most of our prod­ucts on our­selves.”

Hermione looked ner­vous. “It is safe, isn’t it?” she asked.

“Course it is,” said Fred brac­ing­ly. “Come on, Har­ry, I’ll give you a tour.”

Har­ry left Hermione dab­bing her black eye with paste and fol­lowed Fred to­ward the back of the shop, where he saw a stand of card and rope tricks.

“Mug­gle mag­ic tricks!” said Fred hap­pi­ly, point­ing them out. “For freaks like Dad, you know, who love Mug­gle stuff. It’s not a big earn­er, but we do fair­ly steady busi­ness, they’re great nov­el­ties… Oh, here’s George…”

Fred’s twin shook Har­rys hand en­er­get­ical­ly.

“Giv­ing him the tour? Come through the back, Har­ry, that’s where we’re mak­ing the re­al mon­ey…pock­et any­thing, you, and you’ll pay in more than Galleons!” he added warn­ing­ly to a small boy who hasti­ly whipped his hand out of the tub la­beled:

ED­IBLE DARK MARKS—-THEY’LL MAKE ANY­ONE SICK!

George pushed back a cur­tain be­side the Mug­gle tricks and Har­ry saw a dark­er, less crowd­ed room. The pack­ag­ing on the prod­ucts lin­ing these shelves was more sub­dued.

“We’ve just de­vel­oped this more se­ri­ous line,” said Fred. “Fun­ny how it hap­pened…”

“You wouldn’t be­lieve how many peo­ple, even peo­ple who work at the Min­istry, can’t do a de­cent Shield Charm,” said George. “‘Course, they didn’t have you teach­ing them, Har­ry.”

“That’s right… Well, we thought Shield Hats were a bit of a laugh, you know, chal­lenge your mate to jinx you while wear­ing it and watch his face when the jinx just bounces off. But the Min­istry bought five hun­dred for all its sup­port staff! And we’re still get­ting mas­sive or­ders!”

“So we’ve ex­pand­ed in­to a range of Shield Cloaks, Shield Gloves…”

“… I mean, they wouldn’t help much against the Un­for­giv­able Curs­es, but for mi­nor to mod­er­ate hex­es or jinx­es…”

“And then we thought we’d get in­to the whole area of De­fense Against the Dark Arts, be­cause it’s such a mon­ey spin­ner,” con­tin­ued George en­thu­si­as­ti­cal­ly. “This is cool. Look, In­stant Dark­ness Pow­der, we’re im­port­ing it from Pe­ru. Handy if you want to make a quick es­cape.”

“And our De­coy Det­ona­tors are just walk­ing off the shelves, look,” said Fred, point­ing at a num­ber of weird­look­ing black horn­type ob­jects that were in­deed at­tempt­ing to scur­ry out of sight. “You just drop one sur­rep­ti­tious­ly and it’ll run off and make a nice loud noise out of sight, giv­ing you a di­ver­sion if you need one.

“Handy,” said Har­ry, im­pressed.

“Here,” said George, catch­ing a cou­ple and throw­ing them to Har­ry.

A young witch with short blonde hair poked her head around the cur­tain; Har­ry saw that she too was wear­ing ma­gen­ta staff robes.

“There’s a cus­tomer out here look­ing for a joke caul­dron, Mr. Weasley and Mr. Weasley,” she said.

Har­ry found it very odd to hear Fred and George called “Mr. Weasley,” but they took it in their stride.

“Right you are, Ver­ity, I’m com­ing,” said George prompt­ly. “Har­ry, you help your­self to any­thing you want, all right? No charge.”

“I can’t do that!” said Har­ry, who had al­ready pulled out his mon­ey bag to pay for the De­coy Det­ona­tors.

“You don’t pay here,” said Fred firm­ly, wav­ing away Har­ry’s gold.

“But…”

“You gave us our start­up loan, we haven’t for­got­ten,” said George stern­ly “Take what­ev­er you like, and just re­mem­ber to tell peo­ple where you got it, if they ask.”

George swept off through the cur­tain to help with the cus­tomers, and Fred led Har­ry back in­to the main part of the shop to find Hermione and Gin­ny still por­ing over the Patent­ed Day­dream Charms.

“Haven’t you girls found our spe­cial Won­der­Witch prod­ucts yet?” asked Fred. “Fol­low me, ladies…”

Near the win­dow was an ar­ray of vi­olent­ly pink prod­ucts around which a clus­ter of ex­cit­ed girls was gig­gling en­thu­si­as­ti­cal­ly. Hermione and Gin­ny both hung back, look­ing wary.

“There you go,” said Fred proud­ly. “Best range of love po­tions you’ll find any­where.”

Gin­ny raised an eye­brow skep­ti­cal­ly. “Do they work?” she asked.

“Cer­tain­ly they work, for up to twen­ty­four hours at a time de­pend­ing on the weight of the boy in ques­tion…”

“… and the at­trac­tive­ness of the girl,” said George, reap­pear­ing sud­den­ly at their side. “But we’re not sell­ing them to our sis­ter,” he added, be­com­ing sud­den­ly stern, “not when she’s al­ready got about five boys on the go from what we’ve…”

“What­ev­er you’ve heard from Ron is a big fat lie,” said Gin­ny calm­ly, lean­ing for­ward to take a small pink pot off the shelf. “What’s this?”

“Guar­an­teed tensec­ond pim­ple van­ish­er,” said Fred. “Ex­cel­lent on ev­ery­thing from boils to black­heads, but don’t change the sub­ject. Are you or are you not cur­rent­ly go­ing out with a boy called Dean Thomas?”

“Yes, I am,” said Gin­ny. “And last time I looked, he was def­inite­ly one boy, not five. What are those?”

She was point­ing at a num­ber of round balls of fluff in shades of pink and pur­ple, all rolling around the bot­tom of a cage and emit­ting high­pitched squeaks.

“Pygmy Puffs,” said George. “Minia­ture puffskeins, we can…t breed them fast enough. So what about Michael Cor­ner?”

“I dumped him, he was a bad los­er,” said Gin­ny, putting a fin­ger through the bars of the cage and watch­ing the Pygmy Puffs crowd around it. “They’re re­al­ly cute!”

“They’re fair­ly cud­dly, yes,” con­ced­ed Fred. “But you’re mov­ing through boyfriends a bit fast, aren’t you?”

Gin­ny turned to look at him, her hands on her hips. There was such a Mrs. Weasley­ish glare on her face that Har­ry was sur­prised Fred didn’t re­coil.

“It’s none of your busi­ness. And I’ll thank you” she added an­gri­ly to Ron, who had just ap­peared at George’s el­bow, laden with mer­chan­dise, “not to tell tales about me to these two!”

“That’s three Galleons, nine Sick­les, and a Knut,” said Fred, ex­am­in­ing the many box­es in Ron’s arms. “Cough up.”

“I’m your broth­er!”

“And that’s our stuff you’re nick­ing. Three Galleons, nine Sick­les. I’ll knock off the Knut.”

“But I haven’t got three Galleons, nine Sick­les!”

“You’d bet­ter put it back then, and mind you put it on the right shelves.”

Ron dropped sev­er­al box­es, swore, and made a rude hand ges­ture at Fred that was un­for­tu­nate­ly spot­ted by Mrs. Weasley, who had cho­sen that mo­ment to ap­pear.

“If I see you do that again I’ll jinx your fin­gers to­geth­er,” she said sharply.

“Mum, can I have a Pygmy Puff?” said Gin­ny at once.

“A what?” said Mrs. Weasley war­ily.

“Look, they’re so sweet…”

Mrs. Weasley moved aside to look at the Pygmy Puffs, and Har­ry, Ron, and Hermione mo­men­tar­ily had an unim­ped­ed view out of the win­dow. Dra­co Mal­foy was hur­ry­ing up the street alone. As he passed Weasleys’ Wiz­ard Wheezes, he glanced over his shoul­der. Sec­onds lat­er, he moved be­yond the scope of the win­dow and they lost sight of him.

“Won­der where his mum­my is?” said Har­ry, frown­ing.

“Giv­en her the slip by the looks of it,” said Ron.

“Why, though?” said Hermione.

Har­ry said noth­ing; he was think­ing too hard. Nar­cis­sa Mal­foy would not have let her pre­cious son out of her sight will­ing­ly; Mal­foy must have made a re­al ef­fort to free him­self from her clutch­es.

Har­ry, know­ing and loathing Mal­foy, was sure the rea­son could not be in­no­cent.

He glanced around. Mrs. Weasley and Gin­ny were bend­ing over the Pygmy Puffs. Mr. Weasley was de­light­ed­ly ex­am­in­ing a pack of Mug­gle marked play­ing cards. Fred and George were both help­ing cus­tomers. On the oth­er side of the glass, Ha­grid was stand­ing with his back to them, look­ing up and down the street.

“Get un­der here, quick,” said Har­ry, pulling his In­vis­ibil­ity Cloak out of his bag.

“Oh, I don’t know, Har­ry,” said Hermione, look­ing un­cer­tain­ly to­ward Mrs. Weasley.

“Come on,” said Ron.

She hes­itat­ed for a sec­ond longer, then ducked un­der the cloak with Har­ry and Ron. No­body no­ticed them van­ish; they were all too in­ter­est­ed in Fred and George’s prod­ucts. Har­ry, Ron, and Hermione squeezed their way out of the door as quick­ly as they could, but by the time they gained the street, Mal­foy had dis­ap­peared just as suc­cess­ful­ly as they had.

“He was go­ing in that di­rec­tion,” mur­mured Har­ry as qui­et­ly as pos­si­ble, so that the hum­ming Ha­grid would not hear them…Cmon…

They scur­ried along, peer­ing left and right, through shop win­dows and doors, un­til Hermione point­ed ahead.

“That’s him, isn’t it?” she whis­pered. “Turn­ing left?”

“Big sur­prise,” whis­pered Ron.

For Mal­foy had glanced around, then slid in­to Knock­turn Al­ley and out of sight.

“Quick, or we’ll lose him,” said Har­ry, speed­ing up.

“Our feet’ll be seen!” said Hermione anx­ious­ly, as the cloak flapped a lit­tle around their an­kles; it was much more dif­fi­cult hid­ing all three of them un­der the cloak nowa­days.

“It doesn’t mat­ter,” said Har­ry im­pa­tient­ly. “Just hur­ry!”

But Knock­turn Al­ley, the side street de­vot­ed to the Dark Arts, looked com­plete­ly de­sert­ed. They peered in­to win­dows as they passed, but none of the shops seemed to have any cus­tomers at all. Har­ry sup­posed it was a bit of a give­away in these dan­ger­ous and sus­pi­cious times to buy Dark ar­ti­facts… or at least, to be seen buy­ing them.

Hermione gave his arm a hard pinch.

“Ouch!”

“Shh! Look! He’s in there!” she breathed in Har­ry’s ear.

They had drawn lev­el with the on­ly shop in Knock­turn Al­ley that Har­ry had ev­er vis­it­ed, Bor­gin and Burkes, which sold a wide va­ri­ety of sin­is­ter ob­jects. There in the midst of the cas­es full of skulls and old bot­tles stood Dra­co Mal­foy with his back to them, just vis­ible be­yond the very same large black cab­in­et in which Har­ry had once hid­den to avoid Mal­foy and his fa­ther. Judg­ing by the move­ments of Mal­foy’s hands, he was talk­ing an­imat­ed­ly. The pro­pri­etor of the shop, Mr. Bor­gin, an oily­haired, stoop­ing man, stood fac­ing Mal­foy. He was wear­ing a cu­ri­ous ex­pres­sion of min­gled re­sent­ment and fear.

“If on­ly we could hear what they’re say­ing!” said Hermione.

“We can!” said Ron ex­cit­ed­ly. “Hang on, damn.”

He dropped a cou­ple more of the box­es he was still clutch­ing as he fum­bled with the largest.

“Ex­tend­able Ears, look!”

“Fan­tas­tic!” said Hermione, as Ron un­rav­eled the long, flesh­col­ored strings and be­gan to feed them to­ward the bot­tom of the door. “Oh, I hope the door isn’t Im­per­turbable…”

“No!” said Ron glee­ful­ly. “Lis­ten!”

They put their heads to­geth­er and lis­tened in­tent­ly to the ends of the strings, through which Mal­foy’s voice could be heard loud and clear, as though a ra­dio had been turned on.

“… you know how to fix it?”

“Pos­si­bly,” said Bor­gin, in a tone that sug­gest­ed he was un­will­ing to com­mit him­self. “I’ll need to see it, though. Why don’t you bring it in­to the shop?”

“I can’t,” said Mal­foy. “It’s got to stay put. I just need you to tell me how to do it.”

Har­ry saw Bor­gin lick his lips ner­vous­ly.

“Well, with­out see­ing it, I must say it will be a very dif­fi­cult job, per­haps im­pos­si­ble. I couldn’t guar­an­tee any­thing.”

“No?” said Mal­foy, and Har­ry knew, just by his tone, that Mal­foy was sneer­ing. “Per­haps this will make you more con­fi­dent.”

He moved to­ward Bor­gin and was blocked from view by the cab­in­et. Har­ry, Ron, and Hermione shuf­fled side­ways to try and keep him in sight, but all they could see was Bor­gin, look­ing very fright­ened.

“Tell any­one,” said Maifoy, “and there will be ret­ri­bu­tion. You know Fen­rir Grey­back? He’s a fam­ily friend. He’ll be drop­ping in from time to time to make sure you’re giv­ing the prob­lem your full at­ten­tion.”

“There will be no need for…”

“I’ll de­cide that,” said Mal­foy. “Well, I’d bet­ter be off. And don’t for­get to keep that one safe, I’ll need it.”

“Per­haps you’d like to take it now?”

“No, of course I wouldn’t, you stupid, lit­tle man, how would I look car­ry­ing that down the street? Just don’t sell it.”

“Of course not… sir.”

Bor­gin made a bow as deep as the one Har­ry had once seen him give Lu­cius Mal­foy.

“Not a word to any­one, Bor­gin, and that in­cludes my moth­er, un­der­stand?”

“Nat­ural­ly, nat­ural­ly,” mur­mured Bor­gin, bow­ing again.

Next mo­ment, the bell over the door tin­kled loud­ly as Mal­foy stalked out of the shop look­ing very pleased with him­self. He passed so close to Har­ry, Ron, and Hermione that they felt the cloak flut­ter around their knees again. In­side the shop, Bor­gin re­mained frozen; his unc­tu­ous smile had van­ished; he looked wor­ried.

“What was that about?” whis­pered Ron, reel­ing in the Ex­tend­able Ears.

“Dun­no,” said Har­ry, think­ing hard. “He wants some­thing mend­ed… and he wants to re­serve some­thing in there… Could you see what he point­ed at when he said ‘that one’?”

“No, he was be­hind that cab­in­et…”

“You two stay here,” whis­pered Hermione.

“What are you… ?”

But Hermione had al­ready ducked out from un­der the cloak. She checked her hair in the re­flec­tion in the glass, then marched in­to the shop, set­ting the bell tin­kling again. Ron hasti­ly fed the Ex­tend­able Ears back un­der the door and passed one of the strings to Har­ry.

“Hel­lo, hor­ri­ble morn­ing, isn’t it?” Hermione said bright­ly to Bor­gin, who did not an­swer, but cast her a sus­pi­cious look. Hum­ming cheer­ily, Hermione strolled through the jum­ble of ob­jects on dis­play.

“Is this neck­lace for sale?” she asked, paus­ing be­side a glass­front­ed case.

“If you’ve got one and a half thou­sand Galleons,” said Mr. Bor­gin cold­ly.

“Oh… er… no, I haven’t got quite that much,” said Hermione, walk­ing on. “And… what about this love­ly… um… skull?”

“Six­teen Galleons.”

“So it’s for sale, then? It isn’t be­ing… kept for any­one?”

Mr. Bor­gin squint­ed at her. Har­ry had the nasty feel­ing he knew ex­act­ly what Hermione was up to. Ap­par­ent­ly Hermione felt she had been rum­bled too be­cause she sud­den­ly threw cau­tion to the winds.

“The thing is, that… er… boy who was in here just now, Dra­co Mal­foy, well, he’s a friend of mine, and I want to get him a birth­day present, but if he’s al­ready re­served any­thing, I ob­vi­ous­ly don’t want to get him the same thing, so… um…”

It was a pret­ty lame sto­ry in Har­ry’s opin­ion, and ap­par­ent­ly Bor­gin thought so too.

“Out,” he said sharply. “Get out!”

Hermione did not wait to be asked twice, but hur­ried to the door with Bor­gin at her heels. As the bell tin­kled again, Bor­gin slammed the door be­hind her and put up the closed sign.

“Ah well,” said Ron, throw­ing the cloak back over Hermione. “Worth a try, but you were a bit ob­vi­ous…”

“Well, next time you can show me how it’s done, Mas­ter of Mys­tery!” she snapped.

Ron and Hermione bick­ered all the way back to Weasleys’

Wiz­ard Wheezes, where they were forced to stop so that they could dodge un­de­tect­ed around a very anx­ious­look­ing Mrs. Weasley and Ha­grid, who had clear­ly no­ticed their ab­sence. Once in the shop, Har­ry whipped off the In­vis­ibil­ity Cloak, hid it in his bag, and joined in with the oth­er two when they in­sist­ed, in an­swer to Mrs. Weasleys ac­cu­sa­tions, that they had been in the back room all along, and that she could not have looked prop­er­ly.
