Chapter 27: The Lightning-Struck Tower


Once back un­der the star­ry sky, Har­ry heaved Dum­ble­dore on to the top of the near­est boul­der and then to his feet. Sod­den and shiv­er­ing, Dum­ble­dore’s weight still up­on him, Har­ry con­ cen­trat­ed hard­er than he had ev­er done up­on his des­ti­na­tion: Hogsmeade. Clos­ing his eyes, grip­ping Dum­ble­dore’s arm as tight­ly as he could, he stepped for­wards in­to that feel­ing of hor­ri­ble com­pres­sion.

He knew it had worked be­fore he opened his eyes: the smell of salt, the sea breeze had gone. He and Dum­ble­dore were shiv­er­ing and drip­ping in the mid­dle of the dark High Street in Hogsmeade. For one hor­ri­ble mo­ment Har­ry’s imag­ina­tion showed him more In­feri creep­ing to­wards him around the sides of shops, but he blinked and saw that noth­ing was stir­ring; all was still, the dark­ness com­plete but for a few street­lamps and lit up­per win­dows.

‘We did it, Pro­fes­sor!’ Har­ry whis­pered with dif­fi­cul­ty; he sud­den­ly re­alised that he had a sear­ing stitch in his chest. ‘We did it! We got the Hor­crux!’

Dum­ble­dore stag­gered against him. For a mo­ment, Har­ry thought that his in­ex­pert Ap­pari­tion had thrown Dum­ble­dore off­bal­an­ce; then he saw his face, paler and damper than ev­er in the dis­tant light of a street­lamp.

‘Sir, are you all right?’

‘I’ve been bet­ter,’ said Dum­ble­dore weak­ly, though the cor­ners of his mouth twitched. That po­tion … was no health drink …”

And to Har­ry’s hor­ror, Dum­ble­dore sank on to the ground.

‘Sir - it’s OK, sir, you’re go­ing to be all right, don’t wor­ry -’

He looked around des­per­ate­ly for help, but there was no­body to be seen and all he could think was that he must some­how get Dum­ble­dore quick­ly to the hos­pi­tal wing.

‘We need to get you up to the school, sir … Madam Pom­frey …’

‘No,’ said Dum­ble­dore. ‘It is … Pro­fes­sor Snape whom I need … but I do not think … I can walk very far just yet …’

‘Right - sir, lis­ten - I’m go­ing to knock on a door, find a place you can stay - then I can run and get Madam -’

‘Severus,’ said Dum­ble­dore clear­ly. ‘I need Severus …’

‘All right then, Snape - but I’m go­ing to have to leave you for a mo­ment so I can -’

Be­fore Har­ry could make a move, how­ev­er, he heard run­ ning foot­steps. His heart leapt: some­body had seen, some­body knew they need­ed help - and look­ing around he saw Madam Ros­mer­ta scur­ry­ing down the dark street to­wards them on high­heeled, fluffy slip­pers, wear­ing a silk dress­ing­gown em­broi­dered with drag­ons.

‘I saw you Ap­pa­rate as I was pulling my bed­room cur­tains! Thank good­ness, thank good­ness, I couldn’t think what to - but what’s wrong with Al­bus?’

She came to a halt, pant­ing, and stared down, wideeyed, at Dum­ble­dore.

‘He’s hurt,’ said Har­ry. ‘Madam Ros­mer­ta, can he come in­to the Three Broom­sticks while I go up to the school and get help for him?’

‘You can’t go up there alone! Don’t you re­alise - haven’t you seen -?’

‘If you help me sup­port him,’ said Har­ry, not lis­ten­ing to her, ‘I think we can get him in­side -’

‘What has hap­pened?’ asked Dum­ble­dore. ‘Ros­mer­ta, what’s wrong?’

The - the Dark Mark, Al­bus.’

And she point­ed in­to the sky, in the di­rec­tion of Hog­warts. Dread flood­ed Har­ry at the sound of the words … he turned and looked.

There it was, hang­ing in the sky above the school: the blaz- ing green skull with a ser­pent tongue, the mark Death Eaters left be­hind when­ev­er they had en­tered a build­ing … wher­ev­er they had mur­dered …

‘When did it ap­pear?’ asked Dum­ble­dore, and his hand clenched painful­ly up­on Har­ry’s shoul­der as he strug­gled to his feet.

‘Must have been min­utes ago, it wasn’t there when I put the cat out, but when I got up­stairs -’

‘We need to re­turn to the cas­tle at once,’ said Dum­ble­dore. ‘Ros­mer­ta,’ and though he stag­gered a lit­tle, he seemed whol­ly in com­mand of the sit­ua­tion, ‘we need trans­port - brooms -’

‘I’ve got a cou­ple be­hind the bar,’ she said, look­ing very fright­ened. ‘Shall I run and fetch -?’

‘No, Har­ry can do it.’

Har­ry raised his wand at once.

‘Ac­cio Ros­mer­ta’s brooms.’

A sec­ond lat­er they heard a loud bang as the front door of the pub burst open; two brooms had shot out in­to the street and were rac­ing each oth­er to Har­ry’s side, where they stopped dead, quiv­er­ing slight­ly, at waist height.

‘Ros­mer­ta, please send a mes­sage to the Min­istry,’ said Dum­ble­dore, as he mount­ed the broom near­est him. ‘It might be that no­body with­in Hog­warts has yet re­alised any­thing is wrong … Har­ry, put on your In­vis­ibil­ity Cloak.’

Har­ry pulled his Cloak out of his pock­et and threw it over him­self be­fore mount­ing his broom; Madam Ros­mer­ta was al­ready tot­ter­ing back to­wards her pub as Har­ry and Dum­ble­dore kicked off from the ground and rose up in­to the air. As they sped to­wards the cas­tle, Har­ry glanced side­ways at Dum­ble­dore, ready to grab him should he fall, but the sight of the Dark Mark seemed to have act­ed up­on Dum­ble­dore like a stim­ulant: he was bent low over his broom, his eyes fixed up­on the Mark, his long sil­ver hair and beard fly­ing be­hind him in the night air. And Har­ry, too, looked ahead at the skull, and fear swelled in­side him like a ven­omous bub­ble, com­press­ing his lungs, driv­ing all oth­er dis­com­fort from his mind …

How long had they been away? Had Ron, Hermione and Gin­ny’s luck run out by now? Was it one of them who had caused the Mark to be set over the school, or was it Neville, or Lu­na, or some oth­er mem­ber of the DA? And if it was … he was the one who had told them to pa­trol the cor­ri­dors, he had asked them to leave the safe­ty of their beds … would he be re­spon­si­ble, again, for the death of a friend?

As they flew over the dark, twist­ing lane down which they had walked ear­li­er, Har­ry heard, over the whistling of the night air in his ears, Dum­ble­dore mut­ter­ing in some strange lan­guage again. He thought he un­der­stood why as he felt his broom shud­der for a mo­ment when they flew over the bound­ary wall in­to the grounds: Dum­ble­dore was un­do­ing the en­chant­ments he him­self had set around the cas­tle, so that they could en­ter at speed. The Dark Mark was glit­ter­ing di­rect­ly above the As­tron­omy Tow­er, the high­est of the cas­tle. Did that mean the death had oc­curred there?

Dum­ble­dore had al­ready crossed the crenel­lat­ed ram­parts and was dis­mount­ing; Har­ry land­ed next to him sec­onds lat­er and looked around.

The ram­parts were de­sert­ed. The door to the spi­ral stair­case that led back in­to the cas­tle was closed. There was no sign of a strug­gle, of a fight to the death, of a body.

‘What does it mean?’ Har­ry asked Dum­ble­dore, look­ing up at the green skull with its ser­pent’s tongue glint­ing evil­ly above them. ‘Is it the re­al Mark? Has some­one def­inite­ly been - Pro­fes­sor?’

In the dim green glow from the Mark Har­ry saw Dum­ble­dore clutch­ing at his chest with his black­ened hand.

‘Go and wake Severus,’ said Dum­ble­dore faint­ly but clear­ly. Tell him what has hap­pened and bring him to me. Do noth­ ing else, speak to no­body else and do not re­move your Cloak. I shall wait here.’

‘But -’

‘You swore to obey me, Har­ry - go!’

Har­ry hur­ried over to the door lead­ing to the spi­ral stair­case, but his hand had on­ly just closed up­on the iron ring of the door when he heard run­ning foot­steps on the oth­er side. He looked round at Dum­ble­dore, who ges­tured to him to re­treat. Har­ry backed away, draw­ing his wand as he did so.

The door burst open and some­body erupt­ed through it and shout­ed: ‘Ex­pel­liar­mus!’

Har­ry’s body be­came in­stant­ly rigid and im­mo­bile, and he felt him­self fall back against the Tow­er wall, propped like an un­steady stat­ue, un­able to move or speak. He could not un­der­stand how it had hap­pened - Ex­pel­liar­mus was not a Freez­ing Charm -

Then, by the light of the Mark, he saw Dum­ble­dore’s wand fly­ing in an arc over the edge of the ram­parts and un­der­stood … Dum­ble­dore had word­less­ly im­mo­bilised Har­ry, and the sec­ond he had tak­en to per­form the spell had cost him the chance of de­fend­ing him­self.

Stand­ing against the ram­parts, very white in the face, Dum­ble­dore still showed no sign of pan­ic or dis­tress. He mere­ly looked across at his dis­armer and said, ‘Good evening, Dra­co.’

Mal­foy stepped for­wards, glanc­ing around quick­ly to check that he and Dum­ble­dore were alone. His eyes fell up­on the sec­ond broom.

‘Who else is here?’

‘A ques­tion 1 might ask you. Or are you act­ing alone?’

Har­ry saw Mal­foy’s pale eyes shift back to Dum­ble­dore in the green­ish glare of the Mark.

‘No,’ he said. ‘I’ve got back­up. There are Death Eaters here in your school tonight.’

‘Well, well,’ said Dum­ble­dore, as though Mal­foy was show­ ing him an am­bi­tious home­work project. ‘Very good in­deed. You found a way to let them in, did you?’

‘Yeah,’ said Mal­foy, who was pant­ing. ‘Right un­der your nose and you nev­er re­alised!’

‘In­ge­nious,’ said Dum­ble­dore. ‘Yet … for­give me … where are they now? You seem un­sup­port­ed.’

They met some of your guard. They’re hav­ing a fight down be­low. They won’t be long … I came on ahead. I - I’ve got a job to do.’

‘Well, then, you must get on and do it, my dear boy,’ said Dum­ble­dore soft­ly.

There was si­lence. Har­ry stood im­pris­oned with­in his own in­vis­ible, par­al­ysed body, star­ing at the two of them, his ears strain­ing to hear sounds of the Death Eaters’ dis­tant fight, and in front of him, Dra­co Mal­foy did noth­ing but stare at Al­bus Dum­ble­dore who, in­cred­ibly, smiled.

‘Dra­co, Dra­co, you are not a killer.’

‘How do you know?’ said Mal­foy at once.

He seemed to re­alise how child­ish the words had sound­ed; Har­ry saw him flush in the Mark’s green­ish light.

‘You don’t know what I’m ca­pa­ble of,’ said Mal­foy more force­ful­ly, ‘you don’t know what I’ve done!’

‘Oh, yes, I do,’ said Dum­ble­dore mild­ly. ‘You al­most killed Katie Bell and Ronald Weasley. You have been try­ing, with in­creas­ing des­per­ation, to kill me all year. For­give me, Dra­co, but they have been fee­ble at­tempts … so fee­ble, to be hon­est, that I won­der whether your heart has been re­al­ly in it…’

‘It has been in it!’ said Mal­foy ve­he­ment­ly. ‘I’ve been work­ ing on it all year, and tonight -’

Some­where in the depths of the cas­tle be­low Har­ry heard a muf­fled yell. Mal­foy stiff­ened and glanced over his shoul­der.

‘Some­body is putting up a good fight,’ said Dum­ble­dore con­ver­sa­tion­al­ly. ‘But you were say­ing … yes, you have man­aged to in­tro­duce Death Eaters in­to my school which, I ad­mit, I thought im­pos­si­ble … how did you do it?’

But Mal­foy said noth­ing: he was still lis­ten­ing to what­ev­er was hap­pen­ing be­low and seemed al­most as par­al­ysed as Har­ry was.

‘Per­haps you ought to get on with the job alone,’ sug­gest­ed Dum­ble­dore. ‘What if your back­up has been thwart­ed by my guard? As you have per­haps re­alised, there are mem­bers of the Or­der of the Phoenix here tonight, too. And af­ter all, you don’t re­al­ly need help … I have no wand at the mo­ment … I can­not de­fend my­self.’

Mal­foy mere­ly stared at him.

‘I see,’ said Dum­ble­dore kind­ly, when Mal­foy nei­ther

moved nor spoke. ‘You are afraid to act un­til they join

you.’»

‘I’m not afraid!’ snarled Mal­foy, though he still made no move to hurt Dum­ble­dore. ‘It’s you who should be scared!’

‘But why? I don’t think you will kill me, Dra­co. Killing is not near­ly as easy as the in­no­cent be­lieve … so tell me, while we wait for your friends … how did you smug­gle them in here? It seems to have tak­en you a long time to work out how to do it.’

Mal­foy looked as though he was fight­ing down the urge to shout, or to vom­it. He gulped and took sev­er­al deep breaths, glar­ing at Dum­ble­dore, his wand point­ing di­rect­ly at the lat­ter’s heart. Then, as though he could not help him­self, he said, ‘1 had to mend that bro­ken Van­ish­ing Cab­in­et that no one’s used for years. The one Mon­tague got lost in last year.’

‘Aaaah.’

Dum­ble­dore’s sigh was half a groan. He closed his eyes for a mo­ment.

That was clever … there is a pair, I take it?’

‘The oth­er’s in Bor­gin and Burkes,’ said Mal­foy, ‘and they make a kind of pas­sage be­tween them. Mon­tague told me that when he was stuck in the Hog­warts one, he was trapped in lim­bo but some­times he could hear what was go­ing on at school, and some­times what was go­ing on in the shop, as if the Cab­in­et was trav­el­ling be­tween them, but he couldn’t make any­one hear him … in the end he man­aged to Ap­pa­rate out, even though he’d nev­er passed his test. He near­ly died do­ing it. Ev­ery­one thought it was a re­al­ly good sto­ry, but I was the on­ly one who re­alised what it meant - even Bor­gin didn’t know - 1 was the one who re­alised there could be a way in­to Hog­warts through the Cab­in­ets if I fixed the bro­ken one.’

‘Very good,’ mur­mured Dum­ble­dore. ‘So the Death Eaters were able to pass from Bor­gin and Burkes in­to the school to help you … a clever plan, a very clever plan … and, as you say, right un­der my nose …’

‘Yeah,’ said Mal­foy who, bizarrely, seemed to draw courage and com­fort from Dum­ble­dore’s praise. ‘Yeah, it was!’

‘But there were times,’ Dum­ble­dore went on, ‘weren’t there, when you were not sure you would suc­ceed in mend­ing the Cab­in­et? And you re­sort­ed to crude and bad­ly judged meas­ures such as send­ing me a cursed neck­lace that was bound to reach the wrong hands … poi­son­ing mead there was on­ly the slight­est chance I might drink …’

‘Yeah, well, you still didn’t re­alise who was be­hind that stuff, did you?’ sneered Mal­foy, as Dum­ble­dore slid a lit­tle down the ram­parts, the strength in his legs ap­par­ent­ly fad­ing, and Har­ry strug­gled fruit­less­ly, mute­ly, against the en­chant­ment bind­ing him.

‘As a mat­ter of fact, I did,’ said Dum­ble­dore. ‘I was sure it was you.’

‘Why didn’t you stop me, then?’ Mal­foy de­mand­ed.

‘I tried, Dra­co. Pro­fes­sor Snape has been keep­ing watch over you on my or­ders -’

‘He hasn’t been do­ing your or­ders, he promised my moth­er -’

‘Of course that is what he would tell you, Dra­co, but -’

‘He’s a dou­bleagent, you stupid old man, he isn’t work­ing for you, you just think he is!’

‘We must agree to dif­fer on that, Dra­co. It so hap­pens that I trust Pro­fes­sor Snape -’

‘Well, you’re los­ing your grip, then!’ sneered Mal­foy. ‘He’s been of­fer­ing me plen­ty of help - want­ing all the glo­ry for him­self - want­ing a bit of the ac­tion - “What are you do­ing? Did you do the neck­lace, that was stupid, it could have blown ev­ery­thing -” But I haven’t told him what I’ve been do­ing in the Room of Re­quire­ment, he’s go­ing to wake up to­mor­row and it’ll all be over and he won’t be the Dark Lord’s favourite any more, he’ll be noth­ing com­pared to me, noth­ing!’

‘Very grat­ify­ing,’ said Dum­ble­dore mild­ly. ‘We all like* ap­pre­ci­ation for our own hard work, of course … but you must have had an ac­com­plice, all the same … some­one in Hogsmeade, some­one who was able to slip Katie the - the - aaaah

Dum­ble­dore closed his eyes again and nod­ded, as though he was about to fall asleep.

‘… of course … Ros­mer­ta. How long has she been un­der the Im­perius Curse?’

‘Got there at last, have you?’ Mal­foy taunt­ed.

There was an­oth­er yell from be­low, rather loud­er than the last. Mal­foy looked ner­vous­ly over his shoul­der again, then back at Dum­ble­dore, who went on, ‘So poor Ros­mer­ta was forced to lurk in her own bath­room and pass that neck­lace to any Hog­warts stu­dent who en­tered the room un­ac­com­pa­nied? And the poi­soned mead … well, nat­ural­ly, Ros­mer­ta was able to poi­son it for you be­fore she sent the bot­tle to Slughorn, be­liev­ing that it was to be my Christ­mas present … yes, very neat … very neat … poor Mr Filch would not, of course, think to check a bot­tle of Ros­mer­ta’s … tell me, how have you been com­mu­ni­cat­ing with Ros­mer­ta? I thought we had all meth­ods of com­mu­ni­ca­tion in and out of the school mon­itored.’

‘En­chant­ed coins,’ said Mal­foy, as though he was com­pelled to keep talk­ing, though his wand hand was shak­ing bad­ly. ‘I had one and she had the oth­er and 1 could send her mes­sages -’

‘Isn’t that the se­cret method of com­mu­ni­ca­tion the group that called them­selves Dum­ble­dore’s Army used last year?’ asked Dum­ble­dore. His voice was light and con­ver­sa­tion­al, but Har­ry saw him slip an inch low­er down the wall as he said it.

‘Yeah, I got the idea from them,’ said Mal­foy, with a twist­ed smile. ‘I got the idea of poi­son­ing the mead from the Mud­blood Granger, as well, I heard her talk­ing in the li­brary about Filch not recog­nis­ing po­tions …’

Hogsmeade, some­one who was able to slip Katie the - the - aaaah

Dum­ble­dore closed his eyes again and nod­ded, as though he was about to fall asleep.

‘… of course … Ros­mer­ta. How long has she been un­der the Im­perius Curse?’

‘Got there at last, have you?’ Mal­foy taunt­ed.

‘Please do not use that of­fen­sive word in front of me,’ said Dum­ble­dore.

Mal­foy gave a harsh laugh.

‘You care about me say­ing “Mud­blood” when I’m about to kill you?’

‘Yes, I do,’ said Dum­ble­dore, and Har­ry saw his feet slide a lit­tle on the floor as he strug­gled to re­main up­right. ‘But as for be­ing about to kill me, Dra­co, you have had sev­er­al long min­utes now. We are quite alone. I am more de­fence­less than you can have dreamed of find­ing me, and still you have not act­ed …’

Mal­foy’s mouth con­tort­ed in­vol­un­tar­ily, as though he had tast­ed some­thing very bit­ter.

‘Now, about tonight,’ Dum­ble­dore went on, ‘I am a lit­tle puz­zled about how it hap­pened … you knew that I had left the school? But of course,’ he an­swered his own ques­tion, ‘Ros­mer­ta saw me leav­ing, she tipped you off us­ing your in­ge­nious coins, I’m sure …’

‘That’s right,’ said Mal­foy. ‘But she said you were just go­ing for a drink, you’d be back …’

‘Well, I cer­tain­ly did have a drink … and I came back … af­ter a fash­ion,’ mum­bled Dum­ble­dore. ‘So you de­cid­ed to spring a trap for me?’

‘We de­cid­ed to put the Dark Mark over the Tow­er and get you to hur­ry up here, to see who’d been killed,’ said Mal­foy. ‘And it worked!’

‘Well … yes and no …’ said Dum­ble­dore. ‘But am I to take it, then, that no­body has been mur­dered?’

‘Some­one’s dead,’ said Mal­foy and his voice seemed to go up an oc­tave as he said it. ‘One of your peo­ple … I don’t know who, it was dark … I stepped over the body … I was* sup­posed to be wait­ing up here when you got back, on­ly your Phoenix lot got in the way …’

‘Yes, they do that,’ said Dum­ble­dore.

There was a bang and shouts from be­low, loud­er than ev­er; it sound­ed as though peo­ple were fight­ing on the ac­tu­al spi­ral stair­case that led to where Dum­ble­dore, Mal­foy and Har­ry stood, and Har­ry’s heart thun­dered un­heard in his in­vis­ible chest … some­one was dead … Mal­foy had stepped over the body … but who was it?

There is lit­tle time, one way or an­oth­er,’ said Dum­ble­dore. ‘So let us dis­cuss your op­tions, Dra­co.’

‘My op­tions!’ said Mal­foy loud­ly. ‘I’m stand­ing here with a wand - I’m about to kill you -’

‘My dear boy, let us have no more pre­tence about that. If you were go­ing to kill me, you would have done it when you first Dis­armed me, you would not have stopped for this pleas­ant chat about ways and means.’

‘I haven’t got any op­tions!’ said Mal­foy, and he was sud­ den­ly as white as Dum­ble­dore. ‘I’ve got to do it! He’ll kill me! He’ll kill my whole fam­ily!’

‘I ap­pre­ci­ate the dif­fi­cul­ty of your po­si­tion,’ said Dum­ble­dore. ‘Why else do you think I have not con­front­ed you be­fore now? Be­cause I knew that you would have been mur­dered if Lord Volde­mort re­alised that I sus­pect­ed you.’

Mal­foy winced at the sound of the name.

‘I did not dare speak to you of the mis­sion with which I knew you had been en­trust­ed, in case he used Legili­men­cy against you,’ con­tin­ued Dum­ble­dore. ‘But now at last we can speak plain­ly to each oth­er … no harm has been done, you have hurt no­body, though you are very lucky that your un­in­ten­tion­al vic­tims sur­vived … I can help you, Dra­co.’

‘No, you can’t,’ said Mal­foy, his wand hand shak­ing very bad­ly in­deed. ‘No­body can. He told me to do it or he’ll kill me. I’ve got no choice.’

‘Come over to the right side, Dra­co, and we can hide you more com­plete­ly than you can pos­si­bly imag­ine. What is more, I can send mem­bers of the Or­der to your moth­er tonight to hide her like­wise. Your fa­ther is safe at the mo­ment in Azk­aban … when the time comes we can pro­tect him too … come over to the right side, Dra­co … you are not a killer …’

Mal­foy stared at Dum­ble­dore.

‘But I got this far, didn’t I?’ he said slow­ly. They thought I’d die in the at­tempt, but I’m here … and you’re in my pow­er … I’m the one with the wand … you’re at my mer­cy …’

‘No, Dra­co,’ said Dum­ble­dore qui­et­ly. ‘It is my mer­cy, and not yours, that mat­ters now.’

Mal­foy did not speak. His mouth was open, his wand hand still trem­bling. Har­ry thought he saw it drop by a frac­tion -

But sud­den­ly foot­steps were thun­der­ing up the stairs and a sec­ond lat­er Mal­foy was buf­fet­ed out of the way as four peo­ple in black robes burst through the door on to the ram­parts. Still par­al­ysed, his eyes star­ing un­blink­ing­ly, Har­ry gazed in ter­ror up­on four strangers: it seemed the Death Eaters had won the fight be­low.

A lumpy­look­ing man with an odd lop­sid­ed leer gave a wheezy gig­gle.

‘Dum­ble­dore cor­nered!’ he said, and he turned to a stocky lit­tle wom­an who looked as though she could be his sis­ter and who was grin­ning ea­ger­ly. ‘Dum­ble­dore wand­less, Dum­ble­dore alone! Well done, Dra­co, well done!’

‘Good evening, Amy­cus,’ said Dum­ble­dore calm­ly, as though wel­com­ing the man to a tea par­ty. ‘And you’ve brought Alec­to too … charm­ing …’

The wom­an gave an an­gry lit­tle tit­ter.

Think your lit­tle jokes’ll help you on your death bed, then?’ she jeered.

‘Jokes? No, no, these are man­ners,’ replied Dum­ble­dore.

‘Do it,’ said the stranger stand­ing near­est to Har­ry, a big, rangy man with mat­ted grey hair and whiskers, whose black Death Eater’s robes looked un­com­fort­ably tight. He had a voice like none that Har­ry had ev­er heard: a rasp­ing bark of a voice. Har­ry could smell a pow­er­ful mix­ture of dirt, sweat and, un­mis­take­ably, of blood com­ing from him. His filthy hands had long yel­low­ish nails.

‘Is that you, Fen­rir?’ asked Dum­ble­dore.

That’s right,’ rasped the oth­er. ‘Pleased to see me, Dum­ble­dore?’

‘No, I can­not say that I am …’

Fen­rir Grey­back grinned, show­ing point­ed teeth. Blood trick­led down his chin and he licked his lips slow­ly, ob­scene­ly.

‘But you know how much I like kids, Dum­ble­dore.’

‘Am I to take it that you are at­tack­ing even with­out the full moon now? This is most un­usu­al … you have de­vel­oped a taste for hu­man flesh that can­not be sat­is­fied once a month?’

That’s right,’ said Grey­back. ‘Shocks you, that, does it, Dum­ble­dore? Fright­ens you?’

‘Well, I can­not pre­tend it does not dis­gust me a lit­tle,’ said Dum­ble­dore. ‘And, yes, I am a lit­tle shocked that Dra­co here in­vit­ed you, of all peo­ple, in­to the school where his friends live…’

‘I didn’t,’ breathed Mal­foy. He was not look­ing at Grey­back; he did not seem to want to even glance at him. ‘I didn’t know he was go­ing to come -’

‘I wouldn’t want to miss a trip to Hog­warts, Dum­ble­dore,’ rasped Grey­back. ‘Not when there are throats to be ripped out … de­li­cious, de­li­cious …’

And he raised a yel­low fin­ger­nail and picked at his front teeth, leer­ing at Dum­ble­dore.

‘1 could do you for af­ters, Dum­ble­dore …’

‘No,’ said the fourth Death Eater sharply. He had a heavy, bru­tal­look­ing face. ‘We’ve got or­ders. Dra­co’s got to do it. Now, Dra­co, and quick­ly.’

Mal­foy was show­ing less res­olu­tion than ev­er. He looked ter­ri­fied as he stared in­to Dum­ble­dore’s face, which was even paler, and rather low­er than usu­al, as he had slid so far down the ram­part wall.

‘He’s not long for this world any­way, if you ask me!’ said the lop­sid­ed man, to the ac­com­pa­ni­ment of his sis­ter’s wheez­ing gig­gles. ‘Look at him - what’s hap­pened to you, then, Dum­by?’

‘Oh, weak­er re­sis­tance, slow­er re­flex­es, Amy­cus,’ said Dum­ble­dore. ‘Old age, in short … one day, per­haps, it will hap­pen to you … if you are lucky …’

‘What’s that mean, then, what’s that mean?’ yelled the Death Eater, sud­den­ly vi­olent. ‘Al­ways the same, weren’t yeh, Dum­by, talk­ing and do­ing noth­ing, noth­ing, I don’t even know why the Dark Lord’s both­er­ing to kill yeh! Come on, Dra­co, do it!’

But at that mo­ment, there were re­newed sounds of scuf­fling from be­low and a voice shout­ed, ‘They’ve blocked the stairs - Re­duc­to! RE­DUC­TO!’

Har­ry’s heart leapt: so these four had not elim­inat­ed all op­po­si­tion, but mere­ly bro­ken through the fight to the top of the Tow­er, and, by the sound of it, cre­at­ed a bar­ri­er be­hind them -

‘Now, Dra­co, quick­ly!’ said the bru­tal­faced man an­gri­ly.

But Mal­foy’s hand was shak­ing so bad­ly that he could bare­ly aim.

Til do it,’ snarled Grey­back, mov­ing to­wards Dum­ble­dore with his hands out­stretched, his teeth bared.

‘I said no!’ shout­ed the bru­tal­faced man; there was a flash of light and the were­wolf was blast­ed out of the way; he hit the ram­parts and stag­gered, look­ing fu­ri­ous. Har­ry’s heart was ham­mer­ing so hard it seemed im­pos­si­ble that no­body could hear him stand­ing there, im­pris­oned by Dum­ble­dore’s spell -if he could on­ly move, he could aim a curse from un­der the Cloak -

‘Dra­co, do it, or stand aside so one of us -’ screeched the wom­an, but at that pre­cise mo­ment the door to the ram­parts burst open once more and there stood Snape, his wand clutched in his hand as his black eyes swept the scene, from Dum­ble­dore slumped against the wall, to the four Death Eaters, in­clud­ing the en­raged were­wolf, and Mal­foy.

‘We’ve got a prob­lem, Snape,’ said the lumpy Amy­cus, whose eyes and wand were fixed alike up­on Dum­ble­dore, ‘the boy doesn’t seem able -’

But some­body else had spo­ken Snape’s name, quite soft­ly.

‘Severus …’

The sound fright­ened Har­ry be­yond any­thing he had ex­pe­ri­enced all evening. For the first time, Dum­ble­dore was plead­ing.

Snape said noth­ing, but walked for­wards and pushed Mal­foy rough­ly out of the way. The three Death Eaters fell back with­out a word. Even the were­wolf seemed cowed.

Snape gazed for a mo­ment at Dum­ble­dore, and there was re­vul­sion and ha­tred etched in the harsh lines of his face.

‘Severus … please …”

Snape raised his wand and point­ed it di­rect­ly at Dum­ble­dore.

‘Ava­da Ke­davra!’

A jet of green light shot from the end of Snape’s wand and hit Dum­ble­dore square­ly in the chest. Har­ry’s scream of hor­ror nev­er left him; silent and un­mov­ing, he was forced to watch as Dum­ble­dore was blast­ed in­to the air: for a split sec­ond he seemed to hang sus­pend­ed be­neath the shin­ing skull, and then he fell slow­ly back­wards, like a great rag doll, over the bat­tle­ments and out of sight.
