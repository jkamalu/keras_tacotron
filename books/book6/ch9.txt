Chapter 9: The Half-Blood Prince


Har­ry and Ron met Hermione in the com­mon room be­fore break­fast next morn­ing. Hop­ing for some sup­port in his the­ory, Har­ry lost no time in telling Hermione what he had over­heard Mal­foy say­ing on the Hog­warts Ex­press.

“But he was ob­vi­ous­ly show­ing off for Parkin­son, wasn’t he?” in­ter­ject­ed Ron quick­ly, be­fore Hermione could say any­thing.

“Well,” she said un­cer­tain­ly, “I don’t know. It would be like Mal­foy to make him­self seem more im­por­tant than he is … but that’s a big lie to tell…”

“Ex­act­ly,” said Har­ry, but he could nor press the point, be­cause so many peo­ple were try­ing to lis­ten in to his con­ver­sa­tion, not to men­tion star­ing at him and whis­per­ing be­hind their hands.

“It’s rude to point,” Ron snapped at a par­tic­ular­ly mi­nus­cule firstyear boy as they joined the queue to climb out of the por­trait hole. The boy, who had been mut­ter­ing some­thing about Har­ry be­hind his hand to his friend, prompt­ly turned scar­let and top­pled out of the hole in alarm. Ron snig­gered. “I love be­ing a sixth year. And were go­ing to be get­ting free time this year. Whole pe­ri­ods when we can just sit up here and re­lax.”

“We’re go­ing to need that time for study­ing, Ron!” said Hermione, as they set off down the cor­ri­dor.

“Yeah, but not to­day,” said Ron. “To­day’s go­ing to be a re­al loss, I reck­on.”

“Hold it!” said Hermione, throw­ing out an arm and halt­ing a pass­ing fourth year, who was at­tempt­ing to push past her with a limegreen disk clutched tight­ly in his hand. “Fanged Fris­bees banned, hand it over,” she told him stern­ly. The scowl­ing boy hand­ed over the snarling Fris­bee, ducked un­der her arm, and took off af­ter his friends. Ron wait­ed for him to van­ish, then tugged the Fris­bee from Hermione’s grip.

“Ex­cel­lent, I’ve al­ways want­ed one of these.”

Hermione’s re­mon­stra­tion was drowned by a loud gig­gle; Laven­der Brown had ap­par­ent­ly found Ron’s re­mark high­ly amus­ing. She con­tin­ued to laugh as she passed them, glanc­ing back at Ron over her shoul­der. Ron looked rather pleased with him­self.

The ceil­ing of the Great Hall was serene­ly blue and streaked with frail, wispy clouds, just like the squares of sky vis­ible through the high mul­li­oned win­dows. While they tucked in­to por­ridge and eggs and ba­con, Har­ry and Ron told Hermione about their em­barass­ing con­ver­sa­tion with Ha­grid the pre­vi­ous evening.

“But he can’t re­al­ly think we’d con­tin­ue Care of Mag­ical Crea­tures!” she said, look­ing dis­tressed. “I mean, when has any of us ex­pressed . . . you know . . . any en­thu­si­asm?”

“That’s it, though, in­nit?” said Ron, sw­al­low­ing an en­tire fried egg whole. “We were the ones who made the most ef­fort in class­es be­cause we like Ha­grid. But he thinks we liked the stupid sub­ject. D’ya reck­on any­one’s go­ing to go on to N.E.W.T.?”

Nei­ther Har­ry nor Hermione an­swered; there was no need. They knew per­fect­ly well that no­body in their year would want to con­tin­ue Care of Mag­ical Crea­tures. They avoid­ed Ha­grid’s eye and re­turned his cheery wave on­ly half­heart­ed­ly when he left the staff ta­ble ten min­utes lat­er.

Af­ter they had eat­en, they re­mained in their places, await­ing Pro­fes­sor McG­ona­gall’s de­scent from the staff ta­ble. The dis­tri­bu­tion of class sched­ules was more com­pli­cat­ed than usu­al this year, for Pro­fes­sor McG­ona­gall need­ed first to con­firm that ev­ery­body had achieved the nec­es­sary O.W.L. grades to con­tin­ue with their cho­sen N.E.W.T.s.

Hermione was im­me­di­ate­ly cleared to con­tin­ue with Charms, De­fense Against the Dark Arts, Trans­fig­ura­tion, Her­bol­ogy, Arith­man­cy, An­cient Runes, and Po­tions, and shot off to a first pe­ri­od An­cient Runes class with­out fur­ther ado. Neville took a lit­tle longer to sort out; his round face was anx­ious as Pro­fes­sor McG­ona­gall looked down his ap­pli­ca­tion and then con­sult­ed his O.W.L re­sults.

“Her­bol­ogy, fine,” she said. “Pro­fes­sor Sprout will be de­light­ed to see you back with an ‘Out­stand­ing’ O.W.L. And you qual­ify for De­fense Against the Dark Arts with ‘Ex­ceeds Ex­pec­ta­tions.’ But the prob­lem is Trans­fig­ura­tion. I’m sor­ry, Long­bot­tom, but an ‘Ac­cept­able’ re­al­ly isn’t good enough to con­tin­ue to N.E.W.T. lev­el. Just don’t think you’d be able to cope with the course­work.”

Neville hung his head. Pro­fes­sor McG­ona­gall peered at him through her square spec­ta­cles.

“Why do you want to con­tin­ue with Trans­fig­ura­tion, any­way? I’ve nev­er had the im­pres­sion that you par­tic­ular­ly en­joyed it.”

Neville looked mis­er­able and mut­tered some­thing about “my grand­moth­er wants.”

“Hmph,” snort­ed Pro­fes­sot McG­ona­gall. “It’s high time your grand­moth­er learned to be proud of the grand­son she’s got, rather than the one she thinks she ought to have - par­tic­ular­ly af­ter what hap­pened at the Min­istry.”

Neville turned very pink and blinked con­fus­ed­ly; Pro­fes­sor McG­ona­gall had nev­er paid him a com­pli­ment be­fore.

“I’m sor­ry, Long­bot­tom, but I can­not let you in­to my N.E.W.T. class. I see that you have an ‘Ex­ceeds Ex­pec­ta­tions’ in Charm how­ev­er - why not try for a N.E.W.T. in Charms?”

“My grand­moth­er thinks Charms is a soft op­tion,” mum­bled Neville.

“Take Charms,” said Pro­fes­sor McG­ona­gall, “and I shall drop Au­gus­ta a line re­mind­ing her that just be­cause she failed her Charms O.W.L., the sub­ject is not nec­es­sar­ily worth­less.” Smil­ing slight­ly at the look of de­light­ed in­creduli­ty on Neville’s face, Pro­fes­sor McG­ona­gall tapped a blank sched­ule with the tip of her wand and hand­ed it, now car­ry­ing de­tails of his new class­es, to Neville.

Pro­fes­sor McG­ona­gall turned next to Par­vati Patil, whose first ques­tion was whether Firen­ze, the hand­some cen­taur, was still teach­ing Div­ina­tion.

“He and Pro­fes­sor Trelawney are di­vid­ing class­es be­tween them this year,” said Pro­fes­sor McG­ona­gall, a hint of dis­ap­proval in her voice; it was com­mon knowl­edge that she de­spised the sub­ject of Div­ina­tion. “The sixth year is be­ing tak­en by Pro­fes­sor Trelawney.”

Par­vati set off for Div­ina­tion five min­utes lat­er look­ing slight­ly crest­fall­en.

“So, Pot­ter, Pot­ter . . .” said Pro­fes­sor McG­ona­gall, con­sult­ing her notes as she turned to Har­ry. “Charms, De­fense Against the Dark Arts, Her­bol­ogy, Trans­fig­ura­tion … all fine. I must say, I was pleased with your Trans­fig­ura­tion mark, Pot­ter, very pleased. Now, why haven’t you ap­plied to con­tin­ue with Po­tions? I thought it was your am­bi­tion to be­come an Au­ror?”

“It was, but you told me I had to get an ‘Out­stand­ing’ in my O.W.L., Pro­fes­sor.”

“And so you did when Pro­fes­sor Snape was teach­ing the sub­ject. Pro­fes­sor Slughorn, how­ev­er, is per­fect­ly hap­py to ac­cept N.E.W.T. stu­dents with ‘Ex­ceeds Ex­pec­ta­tions’ at O.W.L. Do you wish to pro­ceed with Po­tions?”

“Yes,” said Har­ry, “but I didn’t buy the books or any in­gre­di­ents or any­thing-“

“I’m sure Pro­fes­sor Slughorn will be able to lend you some,” said Pro­fes­sor McG­ona­gall. “Very well, Pot­ter, here is your sched­ule. Oh, by the way- twen­ty hope­fuls have al­ready put down their names for the Gryffind­or Quid­ditch team. I shall pass the list to you in due course and you can fix up tri­als at your leisure.”

A few min­utes lat­er, Ron was cleared to do the same sub­jects as Har­ry, and the two of them left the ta­ble to­geth­er.

“Look,” said Ron de­light­ed­ly, gaz­ing ar his sched­ule, “we’ve got a free pe­ri­od now. . . and a free pe­ri­od af­ter break . . . and af­ter lunch . . . ex­cel­lent.”

They re­turned to the com­mon room, which was emp­ty apart from a half dozen sev­enth years, in­clud­ing Katie Bell, the on­ly re­main­ing mem­ber of the orig­in­al Gryffind­or Quid­ditch team that Har­ry had joined in his first year.

“I thought you’d get that, well done,” she called over, point­ing at the Cap­tains badge on Har­ry’s chest. “Tell me when you call tri­als!”

“Don’t be stupid,” said Har­ry, “you don’t need to try out, I watched you play for five years. . . .”

“You mustn’t start off like that,” she said warn­ing­ly. “For all you know, there’s some­one much bet­ter than me out there. Good teams have been ru­in­ed be­fore now be­cause Cap­tains just kept play­ing the old faces, or let­ting in their friends….”

Ron looked a lit­tle un­com­fort­able and be­gan play­ing with the Fanged Fris­bee Hermione had tak­en from the fourthyear stu­dent. It zoomed around the com­mon room, snarling and at­tempt­ing to take bites of the tapestry. Crook­shanks’s yel­low eyes fol­lowed it and he hissed when it came too close.

An hour lat­er they re­luc­tant­ly left the sun­lit com­mon room for the De­fense Against the Dark Arts class­room four floors be­low. Hermione was al­ready queu­ing out­side, car­ry­ing an arm­ful of heavy books and look­ing put­up­on.

“We got so much home­work for Runes,” she said anx­ious­ly when Har­ry and Ron joined her. “A fif­teen­inch es­say, two trans­la­tions, and I’ve got to read these by Wednes­day!”

“Shame,” yawned Ron.

“You wait,” she said re­sent­ful­ly. “I bet Snape gives us loads.”

The class­room door opened as she spoke, and Snape stepped in­to the cor­ri­dor, his sal­low face framed as ev­er by two cur­tains of greasy black hair. Si­lence fell over the queue im­me­di­ate­ly.

“In­side,” he said.

Har­ry looked around as they en­tered. Snape had im­posed his per­son­al­ity up­on the room al­ready; it was gloo­mi­er than usu­al, as cur­tains had been drawn over the win­dows, and was lit by can­dle­light. New pic­tures adorned the walls, many of them show­ing peo­ple who ap­peared to be in pain, sport­ing gris­ly in­ju­ries or strange­ly con­tort­ed body parts. No­body spoke as they set­tled down, look­ing around at the shad­owy, grue­some pic­tures.

“I have not asked you to take out your books,” said Snape, clos­ing the door and mov­ing to face the class from be­hind his desk; Hermione hasti­ly dropped her copy of Con­fronting the Face­less back in­to her bag and stowed it un­der her chair. “I wish to speak to you, and I want your fullest at­ten­tion.”

His black eyes roved over their up­turned faces, lin­ger­ing for a frac­tion of a sec­ond longer on Har­ry’s than any­one else’s.

“You have had five teach­ers in this sub­ject so far, I be­lieve.”

You be­lieve . . . like you haven’t watched them all come and go, hop­ing you’d be next, thought Har­ry scathing­ly.

“Nat­ural­ly, these teach­ers will all have had their own meth­ods and pri­or­ities. Giv­en this con­fu­sion I am sur­prised so many of you scraped an O.W.L. in this sub­ject. I shall be even more sur­prised if all of you man­age to keep up with the N.E.W.T. work, which will be more ad­vanced.”

Snape set off around the edge of the room, speak­ing now in a low­er voice; the class craned their necks to keep him in view. “The Dark Arts,” said Snape, “are many, var­ied, ev­er­chang­ing, and eter­nal. Fight­ing them is like fight­ing a many­head­ed mon­ster, which, each time a neck is sev­ered, sprouts a head even fiercer and clev­er­er than be­fore. You are fight­ing that which is un­fixed, mu­tat­ing, in­de­struc­tible.”

Har­ry stared at Snape. It was sure­ly one thing to re­spect the Dark Arts as a dan­ger­ous en­emy, an­oth­er to speak of them, as Snape was do­ing, with a lov­ing ca­ress in his voice?

“Your de­fens­es,” said Snape, a lit­tle loud­er, “must there­fore be as flex­ible and in­ven­tive as the arts you seek to un­do. These pic­tures” - he in­di­cat­ed a few of them as he swept past - “give a fair rep­re­sen­ta­tion of what hap­pens to those who suf­fer, for in­stance, the Cru­cia­tus Curse” - he waved a hand to­ward a witch who was clear­ly shriek­ing in agony - “feel the De­men­tor’s Kiss” - a wiz­ard ly­ing hud­dled and blankeyed, slumped against a wall - “or pro­voke the ag­gres­sion of the In­ferius” - a bloody mass up­on ground.

“Has an In­ferius been seen, then?” said Par­vati Patil in a high pitched voice. “Is it def­inite, is he us­ing them?”

“The Dark Lord has used In­feri in the past,” said Snape, “which means you would be wellad­vised to as­sume he might use them again. Now. . . “

He set off again around the oth­er side of the class­room to­ward his desk, and again, they watched him as he walked, his dark robes bil­low­ing be­hind him. ,

“. . . you are, I be­lieve, com­plete novices in the use of non­ver­bal spells. What is the ad­van­tage of a non­ver­bal spell?”

Hermione’s hand shot in­to the air. Snape took his time look­ing around at ev­ery­body else, mak­ing sure he had no choice, be­fore say­ing curt­ly, “Very well - Miss Granger?”

“Your ad­ver­sary has no warn­ing about what kind of mag­ic you’re about to per­form,” said Hermione, “which gives you a split­sec­ond ad­van­tage.”

“An an­swer copied al­most word for word from The Stan­dard Book of Spells, Grade Six,” said Snape dis­mis­sive­ly (over in the cor­ner, Mal­foy snig­gered), “but cor­rect in es­sen­tials. Yes, those who progress in us­ing mag­ic with­out shout­ing in­can­ta­tions gain an el­ement of sur­prise in their spell­cast­ing. Not all wiz­ards can do this, of course; it is a ques­tion of con­cen­tra­tion and mind pow­er which some” - his gaze lin­gered ma­li­cious­ly up­on Har­ry once more - “lack.”

Har­ry knew Snape was think­ing of their dis­as­trous Oc­clu­men­cy lessons of the pre­vi­ous year. He re­fused to drop his gaze, but glow­ered at Snape un­til Snape looked away.

“You will now di­vide,” Snape went on, “in­to pairs. One part­ner will at­tempt to jinx the oth­er with­out speak­ing. The oth­er will at­tempt to re­pel the jinx in equal si­lence. Car­ry on.”

Al­though Snape did not know it, Har­ry had taught at least half the class (ev­ery­one who had been a mem­ber of the D.A.) how to per­form a Shield Charm the pre­vi­ous year. None of them had ev­er cast the charm with­out speak­ing, how­ev­er. A rea­son­able amount of cheat­ing en­sued; many peo­ple were mere­ly whis­per­ing the in­can­ta­tion in­stead of say­ing it aloud. Typ­ical­ly, ten min­utes in­to the les­son Hermione man­aged to re­pel Neville’s mut­tered Jel­lyLegs Jinx with­out ut­ter­ing a sin­gle word, a feat that would sure­ly have earned her twen­ty points for Gryffind­or from any rea­son­able teach­er, thought Har­ry bit­ter­ly, but which Snape ig­nored. He swept be­tween them as they prac­ticed, look­ing just as much like an over­grown bat as ev­er, lin­ger­ing to watch Har­ry and Ron strug­gling with the task.

Ron, who was sup­posed to be jinx­ing Har­ry, was pur­ple in the face, his lips tight­ly com­pressed to save him­self from the temp­ta­tion of mut­ter­ing the in­can­ta­tion. Har­ry had his wand raised, wait­ing on ten­ter­hooks to re­pel a jinx that seemed un­like­ly ev­er to come.

“Pa­thet­ic, Weasley,” said Snape, af­ter a while. “Here — let me show you-“

He turned his wand on Har­ry so fast that Har­ry re­act­ed in­stinc­tive­ly; all thought of non­ver­bal spells for­got­ten, he yelled, “Pro­tego!”

His Shield Charm was so strong Snape was knocked off­bal­an­ce and hit a desk. The whole class had looked around and now watched as Snape right­ed him­self, scowl­ing.

“Do you re­mem­ber me telling you we are prac­tic­ing non­ver­bal spells, Pot­ter?”

“Yes,” said Har­ry stiffly.

“Yes, sir.”

“There’s no need to call me ’sir,’ Pro­fes­sor.” The words had es­caped him be­fore he knew what he was say­ing. Sev­er­al peo­ple gasped, in­clud­ing Hermione. Be­hind Snape, how­ev­er, Ron, Dean, and Sea­mus grinned ap­pre­cia­tive­ly.

“De­ten­tion, Sat­ur­day night, my of­fice,” said Snape. “I do not take cheek from any­one, Pot­ter . . . not even ‘the Cho­sen One.’”

“That was bril­liant, Har­ry!” chor­tled Ron, once they were safe­ly on their way to break a short while lat­er.

“You re­al­ly shouldn’t have said it,” said Hermione, frown­ing at Ron. “What made you?”

“He tried to jinx me, in case you didn’t no­tice!” fumed Har­ry. I had enough of that dur­ing those Oc­clu­men­cy lessons! Why doesn’t he use an­oth­er guinea pig for a change? What’s Dum­ble­dore play­ing at, any­way, let­ting him teach De­fense? Did you hear him talk­ing about the Dark Arts? He loves them! All that un­fixed, in­de­struc­tble stuff –“

“Well,” said Hermione, “I thought he sound­ed a bit like you.”

“Like me?”

“Yes, when you were telling us what it’s like to face Volde­mort. You said it wasn’t just mem­oriz­ing a bunch of spells, you said it was just you and your brains and your guts - well, wasn’t that what Snape was say­ing? That it re­al­ly comes down to be­ing brave and quick­think­ing?”

Har­ry was so dis­armed that she had thought his words as well worth mem­oriz­ing as The Stan­dard Book of Spells that he did not ar­gue.

“Har­ry! Hey, Har­ry!”

Har­ry looked around; Jack Slop­er, one of the Beat­ers on last year’s Gryffind­or Quid­ditch team, was hur­ry­ing to­ward him hold­ing a roll of parch­ment.

“For you,” pant­ed Slop­er. “Lis­ten, I heard you’re the new Cap­tain. When’re you hold­ing tri­als?”

“I’m not sure yet,” said Har­ry, think­ing pri­vate­ly that Slop­er would be very lucky to get back on the team. “I’ll let you know.”

“Oh, right. I was hop­ing it’d be this week­end -“

“But Har­ry was not lis­ten­ing; he had just rec­og­nized the thin, slant­ing writ­ing on the parch­ment. Leav­ing Slop­er in mid­sen­tence, he hur­ried away with Ron and Hermione, un­rolling the parch­ment as he went.

Dear Har­ry, I would like to start our pri­vate lessons this Sat­ur­day. Kind­ly come along to my of­fice at 8 P.M. I hope you are en­joy­ing your first day back at school.

Yours sin­cere­ly,

Al­bus Dum­ble­dore P.S. I en­joy Acid Pops.

“He en­joys Acid Pops?” said Ron, who had read the mes­sage over Har­ry’s shoul­der and was look­ing per­plexed.

“It’s the pass­word to get past the gar­goyle out­side his study,” said Har­ry in a low voice. “Ha! Snape’s not go­ing to be pleased. . . . I won’t be able to do his de­ten­tion!”

He, Ron, and Hermione spent the whole of break spec­ulat­ing on what Dum­ble­dore would teach Har­ry. Ron thought it most like­ly to be spec­tac­ular jinx­es and hex­es of the type the Death Eaters would not know. Hermione said such things were il­le­gal, and thought it much more like­ly that Dum­ble­dore want­ed to teach Har­ry ad­vanced De­fen­sive mag­ic. Af­ter break, she went off to Arith­man­cy while Har­ry and Ron re­turned to the com­mon room where they grudg­ing­ly start­ed Snape’s home­work. This turned out to be so com­plex that they still had not fin­ished when Hermione joined them for their af­ter­lunch free pe­ri­od (though she con­sid­er­ably speed­ed up the pro­cess). They had on­ly just fin­ished when the bell rang for the af­ter­noon’s dou­ble Po­tions and they beat the fa­mil­iar path down to the dun­geon class­room that had, for so long, been Snape’s.

When they ar­rived in the cor­ri­dor they saw that there were on­ly a dozen peo­ple pro­gress­ing to N.E.W.T. lev­el. Crabbe and Goyle had ev­ident­ly failed to achieve the re­quired O.W.L. grade, but four Slytherins had made it through, in­clud­ing Mal­foy. Four Raven­claws were there, and one Huf­flepuff, Ernie Macmil­lan, whom Har­ry liked de­spite his rather pompous man­ner.

“Har­ry,” Ernie said por­ten­tous­ly, hold­ing out his hand as Har­ry ap­proached, “didn’t get a chance to speak in De­fense Against The Dark Arts this morn­ing. Good les­son, I thought, but Shield Charms are old hat, of course, for us old D.A. lags . . . And how are you, Ron — Hermione?”

Be­fore they could say more than “fine,” the dun­geon door opened and Slughorn’s bel­ly pre­ced­ed him out of the door. As they filed in­to the room, his great wal­rus mus­tache curved above his beam­ing mouth, and he greet­ed Har­ry and Zabi­ni with par­tic­ular en­thu­si­asm.

The dun­geon was, most un­usu­al­ly, al­ready full of va­pors and odd smells. Har­ry, Ron, and Hermione sniffed in­ter­est­ed­ly as they passed large, bub­bling caul­drons. The four Slytherins took a ta­ble to­geth­er, as did the four Raven­claws. This left Har­ry, Ron, and Hermione to share a ta­ble with Ernie. They chose the one near­est a gold­col­ored caul­dron that was emit­ting one of the most se­duc­tive scents Har­ry had ev­er in­haled: Some­how it re­mind­ed him si­mul­ta­ne­ous­ly of trea­cle tart, the woody smell of a broom­stick han­dle, and some­thing flow­ery he thought he might have smelled at the Bur­row. He found that he was breath­ing very slow­ly and deeply and that the po­tion’s fumes seemed to be fill­ing him up like drink. A great con­tent­ment stole over him; he grinned across at Ron, who grinned back lazi­ly.

“Now then, now then, now then,” said Slughorn, whose mas­sive out­line was quiv­er­ing through the many shim­mer­ing va­pors. “Scales out, ev­ery­one, and po­tion kits, and don’t for­get your copies

of Ad­vanced Po­tion­Mak­ing. . . .”

“Sir?” said Har­ry, rais­ing his hand.

“Har­ry, m’boy?”

“I haven’t got a book or scales or any­thing - nor’s Ron - we didn’t re­al­ize we’d be able to do the N.E.W.T., you see -“

“Ah, yes, Pro­fes­sor McG­ona­gall did men­tion . . . not to wor­ry, my dear boy, not to wor­ry at all. You can use in­gre­di­ents from the store cup­board to­day, and I’m sure we can lend you some scales, and we’ve got a small stock of old books here, they’ll do un­til you can write to Flour­ish and Blotts. . . .”

Slughorn strode over to a cor­ner cup­board and, af­ter a mo­ment’s for­ag­ing, emerged with two very bat­tered­look­ing copies of Ad­vanced Po­tion­Mak­ing by Li­batius Bor­age, which he gave to Har­ry and Ron along with two sets of tar­nished scales.

“Now then,” said Slughorn, re­turn­ing to the front of the class and in­flat­ing his al­ready bulging chest so that the but­tons on his waist­coat threat­ened to burst off, “I’ve pre­pared a few po­tions for you to have a look at, just out of in­ter­est, you know. These are the kind of thing you ought to be able to make af­ter com­plet­ing your N.E.W.T.s. You ought to have heard of ‘em, even if you haven’t made ‘em yet. Any­one tell me what this one is?”

He in­di­cat­ed the caul­dron near­est the Slytherin ta­ble. Har­ry raised him­self slighty in his seat and saw what looked like plain wa­ter boil­ing away in­side it.

Hermione’s well­prac­ticed hand hit the air be­fore any­body else’s; Slughorn point­ed at her.

“It’s Ver­itaserum, a col­or­less, odor­less po­tion thar forces the drinker to tell the truth,” said Hermione.

“Very good, very good!” said Slughorn hap­pi­ly. “Now,” he con­tin­ued, point­ing at the caul­dron near­est the Raven­claw ta­ble, “this one here is pret­ty well known… Fea­tured in a few Min­istry leaflets late­ly too… Who can - ?”

Hermione’s hand was fastest once more.

“lt’s Polyjuice Po­tion, sir,” she said.

Har­ry too had rec­og­nized the slow­bub­bling, mud­like sub­stance the sec­ond caul­dron, but did not re­sent Hermione get­ting the cred­it for an­swer­ing the ques­tion; she, af­ter all, was the one who had suc­ceed­ed in mak­ing it, back in their sec­ond year. “Ex­cel­lent, ex­cel­lent! Now, this one here . . . yes, my dear?” said Slughorn, now look­ing slight­ly be­mused, as Hermione’s hand punched the air again.

“It’s Amor­ten­tia!”

“It is in­deed. Ir seems al­most fool­ish to ask,” said Slughorn, who was look­ing might­ily im­pressed, “but I as­sume you know what it does?”

“It’s the most pow­er­ful love po­ri­on in the world!” said Hermione.

“Quite right! You rec­og­nized it, I sup­pose, by its dis­tinc­tive moth­erof­pearl sheen?”

“And the steam ris­ing in char­ac­ter­is­tic spi­rals,” said Hermione en­thu­si­as­ti­cal­ly, “and it’s sup­posed to smell dif­fer­ent­ly to each of ac­cord­ing to what at­tracts us, and I can smell fresh­ly mown grass and new parch­ment and -“

But she turned slight­ly pink and did not com­plete the sen­tence.

‘May I ask your name, my dear?” said Slughorn, ig­nor­ing Hermione’s em­bar­rass­ment.

“Hermione Granger, sir.”

“Granger? Granger? Can you pos­si­bly be re­lat­ed to Hec­tor Dag­worth­Granger, who found­ed the Most Ex­traor­di­nary So­ci­ety of Po­tion­eers?”

“No. I don’t think so, sir. I’m Mug­gle­born, you see.”

Har­ry saw Mal­foy lean close to Nott and whis­per some­thing; both of them snig­gered, but Slughorn showed no dis­may; on the con­trary, he beamed and looked from Hermione to Har­ry, who was sit­ting next to her.

“Oho! ‘One of my best friends is Mug­gle­born, and she’s the best in our year!’ I’m as­sum­ing this is the very friend of whom you spoke, Har­ry?”

“Yes, sir,” said Har­ry.

“Well, well, take twen­ty wel­learned points for Gryffind­or, Miss Granger,” said Slughorn ge­nial­ly.

Mal­foy looked rather as he had done the time Hermione had punched him in the face. Hermione turned to Har­ry with a ra­di­ant ex­pres­sion and whis­pered, “Did you re­al­ly tell him I’m the best in the year? Oh, Har­ry!”

“Well, what’s so im­pres­sive about that?” whis­pered Ron, who for some rea­son looked an­noyed. “You are the best in the year - I’d've told him so if he’d asked me!”

Hermione smiled but made a “shhing” ges­ture, so that they could hear what Slughorn was say­ing. Ron looked slight­ly dis­grun­tled.

“Amor­ten­tia doesn’t re­al­ly cre­ate love, of course. It is im­pos­si­ble to man­ufac­ture or im­itate love. No, this will sim­ply cause a pow­er­ful in­fat­ua­tion or ob­ses­sion. It is prob­ably the most dan­ger­ous and pow­er­ful po­tion in this room - oh yes,” he said, nod­ding grave­ly at Mal­foy and Nott, both of whom were smirk­ing skep­ti­cal­ly. “When you have seen as much of life as I have, you will not un­der­es­ti­mate the pow­er of ob­ses­sive love.”

“And now,” said Slughorn, “it is time for us to start work.”

“Sir, you haven’t told us what’s in this one,” said Ernie Macmil­lan, point­ing at a small black caul­dron stand­ing on Slughorn’s desk. The po­tion with­in was splash­ing about mer­ri­ly; it was the col­or of molten gold, and large drops were leap­ing like gold­fish above the sur­face, though not a par­ti­cle had spilled.

“Oho,” said Slughorn again. Har­ry was sure that Slughorn had not for­got­ten the po­tion at all, but had wait­ed to be asked for dra­mat­ic ef­fect. “Yes. That. Well, that one, ladies and gen­tle­men, is a most cu­ri­ous lit­tle po­tion called Fe­lix Fe­li­cis. I take it,” he turned, smil­ing, to look at Hermione, who had let out an au­di­ble gasp, “that you know what Fe­lix Fe­li­cis does, Miss Granger?”

“It’s liq­uid luck,” said Hermione ex­cit­ed­ly. “It makes you lucky!”

The whole class seemed to sit up a lit­tle straighter. Now all Har­ry could see of Mal­foy was the back of his sleek blond head, be­cause he was at last giv­ing Slughorn his full and un­di­vid­ed at­ten­tion.

“Quite right, take an­oth­er ten points for Gryffind­or. Yes, it’s a fun­ny lit­tle po­tion, Fe­lix Fe­li­cis,” said Slughorn. “Des­per­ate­ly tricky to make, and dis­as­trous to get wrong. How­ev­er, if brewed cor­rect­ly, as this has been, you will find that all your en­deav­ors tend to suc­ceed … at least un­til the ef­fects wear off.”

“Why don’t peo­ple drink it all the time, sir?” said Ter­ry Boot ea­ger­ly.

“Be­cause if tak­en in ex­cess, it caus­es gid­di­ness, reck­less­ness, and dan­ger­ous over­con­fi­dence,” said Slughorn. “Too much of a good thing, you know. . . high­ly tox­ic in large quan­ti­ties. But tak­en spar­ing­ly, and very oc­ca­sion­al­ly . . .”

“Have you ev­er tak­en it, sir?” asked Michael Cor­ner with great in­ter­est.

“Twice in my life,” said Slughorn. “Once when I was twen­ty­four, once when I was fifty­sev­en. Two ta­ble­spoon­fuls tak­en with break­fast. Two per­fect days.”

He gazed dream­ily in­to the dis­tance. Whether he was play­act­ing or not, thought Har­ry, the ef­fect was good.

“And that,” said Slughorn, ap­par­ent­ly com­ing back to earth, “is what I shall be of­fer­ing as a prize in this les­son.”

There was si­lence in which ev­ery bub­ble and gur­gle of the sur­round­ing po­tions seemed mag­ni­fied ten­fold.

“One tiny bot­tle of Fe­lix Fe­li­cis,” said Slughorn, tak­ing a mi­nus­cule glass bot­tle with a cork in it out of his pock­et and show­ing it to them all. “Enough for twelve hours’ luck. From dawn till dusk, you will be lucky in ev­ery­thing you at­tempt.”

“Now, I must give you warn­ing that Fe­lix Fe­li­cis is a banned sub­stance in or­ga­nized com­pe­ti­tions . . . sport­ing events, for in­stance, ex­am­ina­tions, or elec­tions. So the win­ner is to use it on an or­di­nary day on­ly . . . and watch how that or­di­nary day be­comes ex­traor­di­nary!”

“So,” said Slughorn, sud­den­ly brisk, “how are you to win this fab­ulous prize? Well, by turn­ing to page ten of Ad­vanced Po­tion Mak­ing. We have a lit­tle over an hour left to us, which should be time for you to make a de­cent at­tempt at the Draught of Liv­ing Death. I know it is more com­plex than any­thing you have at­tempt­ed be­fore, and I do not ex­pect a per­fect po­tion from any­body. The per­son who does best, how­ev­er, will win lit­tle Fe­lix here. Off you go!”

There was a scrap­ing as ev­ery­one drew their caul­drons to­ward them and some loud clunks as peo­ple be­gan adding weights to their scales, but no­body spoke. The con­cen­tra­tion with­in the room was al­most tan­gi­ble. Har­ry saw Mal­foy rif­fling fever­ish­ly through his copy of Ad­vanced Po­tion­Mak­ing., It could not have been clear­er that Mal­foy re­al­ly want­ed that lucky day. Har­ry bent swift­ly over the tat­tered book Slughorn had lent him.

To his an­noy­an­ce he saw that the pre­vi­ous own­er had scrib­bled all over the pages, so that the mar­gins were as black as the print­ed por­tions. Bend­ing low to de­ci­pher the in­gre­di­ents (even here, the pre­vi­ous own­er had made an­no­ta­tions and crossed things out) Har­ry hur­ried off to­ward the store cup­board to find what he need­ed. As he dashed back to his caul­dron, he saw Mal­foy cut­ting up Va­le­ri­an roots as fast as he could.

Ev­ery­one kept glanc­ing around at what the rest of the class was do­ing; this was both an ad­van­tage and a dis­ad­van­tage of Po­tions, that it was hard to keep your work pri­vate. With­in ten min­utes, the whole place was full of bluish steam. Hermione, of course, seemed to have pro­gressed fur­thest. Her po­tion al­ready re­sem­bled the “smooth, black cur­rant­col­ored liq­uid” men­tioned as the ide­al halfway stage.

Hav­ing fin­ished chop­ping his roots, Har­ry bent low over his book again. It was re­al­ly very ir­ri­tat­ing, hav­ing to try and de­ci­pher the di­rec­tions un­der all the stupid scrib­bles of the pre­vi­ous own­er, who for some rea­son had tak­en is­sue with the or­der to cut up the sopophorous bean and had writ­ten in the al­ter­na­tive in­struc­tion:

Crush with flat side of sil­ver dag­ger,

re­leas­es juice bet­ter than cut­ting.

“Sir, I think you knew my grand­fa­ther, Abraxas Mal­foy?” Har­ry looked up; Slughorn was just pass­ing the Slytherin ta­ble.

“Yes,” said Slughorn, with­out look­ing at Mal­foy, “I was sor­ry to hear he had died, al­though of course it wasn’t un­ex­pect­ed, drag­on pox at his age…”

And he walked away. Har­ry bent back over his caul­dron, smirk­ing. He could tell that Mal­foy had ex­pect­ed to be treat­ed like Har­ry or Zabi­ni; per­haps even hoped for some pref­er­en­tial treat­ment of the type he had learned to ex­pect from Snape. It looked as though Mal­foy would have to re­ly on noth­ing but tal­ent to win the bot­tle of Fe­lix Fe­li­cis.

The sopophorous bean was prov­ing very dif­fi­cult to cut up. Har­ry turned to Hermione.

“Can I bor­row your sil­ver knife?”

She nod­ded im­pa­tient­ly, not tak­ing her eyes off her po­tion, which was still deep pur­ple, though ac­cord­ing to the book ought to be turn­ing a light shade of lilac by now.

Har­ry crushed his bean with the flat side of the dag­ger. To his as­ton­ish­ment, it im­me­di­ate­ly ex­ud­ed so much juice he was amazed the shriv­eled bean could have held it all.

Hasti­ly scoop­ing it all in­to the caul­dron he saw, to his sur­prise, that the po­tion im­me­di­ate­ly turned ex­act­ly the shade of lilac de­scribed by the text­book.

His an­noy­an­ce with the pre­vi­ous own­er van­ish­ing on the spot, Har­ry now squint­ed at the next line of in­struc­tions. Ac­cord­ing the book, he had to stir coun­ter­clock­wise un­til the po­tion turned clear as wa­ter. Ac­cord­ing to the ad­di­tion the pre­vi­ous own­er made, how­ev­er, he ought to add a clock­wise stir af­ter ev­ery sev­enth coun­ter­clock­wise stir. Could the old own­er be right twice?

Har­ry stirred coun­ter­clock­wise, held his breath, and stirred once clock­wise. The ef­fect was im­me­di­ate. The po­tion turned pale pink.

“How are you do­ing that?” de­mand­ed Hermione, who was red­faced and whose hair was grow­ing bushi­er and bushi­er in the fumes from her caul­dron; her po­tion was still res­olute­ly pur­ple.

“Add a clock­wise stir -“

“No, no, the book says coun­ter­clock­wise!” she snapped.

Har­ry shrugged and con­tin­ued what he was do­ing. Sev­en stirs coun­ter­dock­wise, one clock­wise, pause . . . sev­en stirs coun­ter­clock­wise, one stir clock­wise . . .

Across the ta­ble, Ron was curs­ing flu­ent­ly un­der his breath; his po­tion looked like liq­uid licorice. Har­ry glanced around. As far as he could see, no one else’s po­tion had turned as pale as his. He felt elat­ed, some­thing that had cer­tain­ly nev­er hap­pened be­fore in this dun­geon.

“And time’s . . . up!” called Slughorn. “Stop stir­ring, please!”

Slughorn moved slow­ly among the ta­bles, peer­ing in­to caul­drons. He made no com­ment, but oc­ca­sion­al­ly gave the po­tions a stir or a sniff. At last he reached the ta­ble where Har­ry, Ron, Hermione, and Ernie were sit­ting. He smiled rue­ful­ly at the tar­like sub­stance in Ron’s caul­dron. He passed over Ernie’s navy con­coc­tion. Hermione’s po­tion he gave an ap­prov­ing nod. Then he saw Har­ry’s, and a look of in­cred­ulous de­light spread over his face.

“The clear win­ner!” he cried to the dun­geon. “Ex­cel­lent, ex­cel­lent, Har­ry! Good lord, it’s clear you’ve in­her­it­ed your moth­er’s tal­ent. She was a dab hand at Po­tions, Lily was! Here you are, then, here you are - one bot­tle of Fe­lix Fe­li­cis, as promised, and use it well!”

Har­ry slipped the tiny bot­tle of gold­en liq­uid in­to his in­ner pock­et, feel­ing an odd com­bi­na­tion of de­light at the fu­ri­ous looks on the Slytherins’ faces and guilt at the dis­ap­point­ed ex­pres­sion on Hermione’s. Ron looked sim­ply dumb­found­ed.

“How did you do that?” he whis­pered to Har­ry as they left the dun­geon.

“Got lucky, I sup­pose,” said Har­ry, be­cause Mal­foy was with­in earshot.

Once they were se­cure­ly en­sconced at the Gryffind­or ta­ble for din­ner, how­ev­er, he felt safe enough to tell them. Hermione’s face be­came stonier with ev­ery word he ut­tered.

“I s’pose you think I cheat­ed?” he fin­ished, ag­gra­vat­ed by her ex­pres­sion.

“Well, it wasn’t ex­act­ly your own work, was it?” she said stiffly.

“He on­ly fol­lowed dif­fer­ent in­struc­tions to ours,” said Ron, “Could’ve been a catas­tro­phe, couldn’t it? But he took a risk and it paid off.” He heaved a sigh. “Slughorn could’ve hand­ed me that book, but no, I get the one no one’s ev­er writ­ten on. Puked on, by the look of page fiftyt­wo, but-“

“Hang on,” said a voice close by Har­ry’s left ear and he caught a sud­den waft of that flow­ery smell he had picked up in Slughorn’s dun­geon. He looked around and saw that Gin­ny had joined them. “Did I hear right? You’ve been tak­ing or­ders from some­thing some­one wrote in a book, Har­ry?”

She looked alarmed and an­gry. Har­ry knew what was on her mind at once.

“It’s noth­ing,” he said re­as­sur­ing­ly, low­er­ing his voice. “It’s not like, you know, Rid­dle’s di­ary. It’s just an old text­book some­one’s scrib­bled on.”

“But you’re do­ing what it says?”

“I just tried a few of the tips writ­ten in the mar­gins, hon­est­ly, Gin­ny, there’s noth­ing fun­ny -“

“Gin­ny’s got a point,” said Hermione, perk­ing up at once. “We ought to check that there’s noth­ing odd about it. I mean, all these fun­ny in­struc­tions, who knows?”

“Hey!” said Har­ry in­dig­nant­ly, as she pulled his copy of Ad­vanced Po­tion­Mak­ing out of his bag and raised her wand. “Spe­cialis Rev­elio!” she said, rap­ping it smart­ly on the front cov­er. Noth­ing what­so­ev­er hap­pened. The book sim­ply lay there, look­ing old and dirty and do­geared.

“Fin­ished?” said Har­ry ir­ri­ta­bly. “Or d’you want to wait and see if it does a few back­flips?”

“It seems all right,” said Hermione, still star­ing at the book sus­pi­cious­ly. “I mean, it re­al­ly does seem to be … just a text­book.”

“Good. Then I’ll have it back,” said Har­ry, snatch­ing it off the ta­ble, but it slipped from his hand and land­ed open on the floor. No­body else was look­ing. Har­ry bent low to re­trieve the book, and as he did so, he saw some­thing scrib­bled along the bot­tom of the back cov­er in the same small, cramped hand­writ­ing as the in­struc­tions that had won him his bot­tle of Fe­lix Fe­li­cis, now safe­ly hid­den in­side a pair of socks in his trunk up­stairs.

This book is the prop­er­ty of the Half Blood Prince.
