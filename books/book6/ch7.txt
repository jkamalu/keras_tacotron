Chapter 7: The Slug Club


Har­ry spent a lot of the last week of the hol­idays pon­der­ing the mean­ing of Mal­foy’s be­hav­ior in Knock­turn Al­ley. What dis­turbed him most was the sat­is­fied look on Mal­foy’s face as he had left the shop. Noth­ing that made Mal­foy look that hap­py could be good news. To his slight an­noy­an­ce, how­ev­er, nei­ther Ron nor Hermione seemed quite as cu­ri­ous about Mal­foy’s ac­tiv­ities as he was; or at least, they seemed to get bored of dis­cussing it af­ter a few days.

“Yes, I’ve al­ready agreed it was fishy, Har­ry,” said Hermione a lit­tle im­pa­tient­ly. She was sit­ting on the win­dowsill in Fred and George’s room with her feet up on one of the card­board box­es and had on­ly grudg­ing­ly looked up from her new copy of Ad­vanced Rune Trans­la­tion. “But haven’t we agreed there could be a lot of ex­pla­na­tions?”

“Maybe he’s bro­ken his Hand of Glo­ry” said Ron vague­ly, as he at­tempt­ed to straight­en his broom­stick’s bent tail twigs. “Re­mem­ber that shriv­eledup arm Mal­foy had?”

“But what about when he said, ‘Don’t for­get to keep that one safe’?” asked Har­ry for the umpteenth time. “That sound­ed to me like Bor­gin’s got an­oth­er one of the bro­ken ob­jects, and Mal­foy wants both.”

“You reck­on?” said Ron, now try­ing to scrape some dirt off his broom han­dle.

“Yeah, I do,” said Har­ry. When nei­ther Ron nor Hermione an­swered, he said, “Mal­foy’s fa­ther’s in Azk­aban. Don’t you think Mal­foy’d like re­venge?”

Ron looked up, blink­ing.

“Mal­foy, re­venge? What can he do about it?”

“That’s my point, I don’t know!” said Har­ry, frus­trat­ed. “But he’s up to some­thing and I think we should take it se­ri­ous­ly. His fa­ther’s a Death Eater and …”

Har­ry broke off, his eyes fixed on the win­dow be­hind Hermione, his mouth open. A startling thought had just oc­curred to him.

“Har­ry?” said Hermione in an anx­ious voice. “What’s wrong?”

“Your scar’s not hurt­ing again, is it?” asked Ron ner­vous­ly.

“He’s a Death Eater,” said Har­ry slow­ly. “He’s re­placed his fa­ther as a Death Eater!”

There was a si­lence; then Ron erupt­ed in laugh­ter. “Mal­foy? He’s six­teen, Har­ry! You think YouKnowWho would let Mal­foy join?”

“It seems very un­like­ly, Har­ry,” said Hermione in a re­pres­sive sort of voice. “What makes you think … ?”

“In Madam Malkin’s. She didn’t touch him, but he yelled and jerked his arm away from her when she went to roll up his sleeve. It was his left arm. He’s been brand­ed with the Dark Mark.”

Ron and Hermione looked at each oth­er.

“Well…” said Ron, sound­ing thor­ough­ly un­con­vinced.

“I think he just want­ed to get out of there, Har­ry,” said Hermione.

“He showed Bor­gin some­thing we couldn’t see,” Har­ry pressed on stub­born­ly. “Some­thing that se­ri­ous­ly scared Bor­gin. It was the Mark, I know it… he was show­ing Bor­gin who he was deal­ing with, you saw how se­ri­ous­ly Bor­gin took him!”

Ron and Hermione ex­changed an­oth­er look.

“I’m not sure, Har­ry…”

“Yeah, I still don’t reck­on YouKnowWho would let Mal­foy join…”

An­noyed, but ab­so­lute­ly con­vinced he was right, Har­ry snatched up a pile of filthy Quid­ditch robes and left the room; Mrs. Weasley had been urg­ing them for days not to leave their wash­ing and pack­ing un­til the last mo­ment. On the land­ing he bumped in­to Gin­ny, who was re­turn­ing to her room car­ry­ing a pile of fresh­ly laun­dered clothes.

“I wouldn’t go in the kitchen just now,” she warned him. “There’s a lot of Phlegm around.”

“I’ll be care­ful not to slip in it.” Har­ry smiled.

Sure enough, when he en­tered the kitchen it was to find Fleur sit­ting at the kitchen ta­ble, in full flow about plans for her wed­ding to Bill, while Mrs. Weasley kept watch over a pile of self­peel­ing sprouts, look­ing badtem­pered.

“… Bill and I ‘ave al­most de­cid­ed on on­ly two brides­maids, Gin­ny and Gabrielle will look very sweet to­gezzer. I am theenk­ing of dress­ing zem in pale gold, pink would of course be ‘or­ri­ble with Gin­ny’s ‘air!”

“Ah, Har­ry!” said Mrs. Weasley loud­ly, cut­ting across Fleur’s mono­logue. “Good, I want­ed to ex­plain about the se­cu­ri­ty ar­range­ments for the jour­ney to Hog­warts to­mor­row. We’ve got Min­istry cars again, and there will be Au­rors wait­ing at the sta­tion.”

“Is Tonks go­ing to be there?” asked Har­ry, hand­ing over his Quid­ditch things.

“No, I don’t think so, she’s been sta­tioned some­where else from what Arthur said.”

“She has let ‘er­self go, zat Tonks,” Fleur mused, ex­am­in­ing her own stun­ning re­flec­tion in the back of a tea­spoon. “A big mis­take if you ask.”

“Yes, thank you,” said Mrs. Weasley tart­ly, cut­ting across Fleur again. “You’d bet­ter get on, Har­ry, I want the trunks ready tonight, if pos­si­ble, so we don’t have the usu­al last­minute scram­ble.”

And in fact, their de­par­ture the fol­low­ing morn­ing was smoother than usu­al. The Min­istry cars glid­ed up to the front of the Bur­row to find them wait­ing, trunks packed; Hermione’s cat, Crook­shanks, safe­ly en­closed in his trav­el­ing bas­ket; and Hed­wig; Ron’s owl, Pig­wid­geon; and Gin­ny’s new pur­ple Pygmy Puff, Arnold, in cages.

“Au revoir, ‘Any,” said Fleur throat­ily, kiss­ing him good­bye. Ron hur­ried for­ward, look­ing hope­ful, but Gin­ny stuck out her foot and Ron fell, sprawl­ing in the dust at Fleur’s feet. Fu­ri­ous, red­faced, and dirtspat­tered, he hur­ried in­to the car with­out say­ing good­bye.

There was no cheer­ful Ha­grid wait­ing for them at King’s Cross Sta­tion. In­stead, two grim­faced, beard­ed Au­rors in dark Mug­gle suits moved for­ward the mo­ment the cars stopped and, flank­ing the par­ty, marched them in­to the sta­tion with­out speak­ing.

“Quick, quick, through the bar­ri­er,” said Mrs. Weasley, who

seemed a lit­tle flus­tered by this aus­tere ef­fi­cien­cy. “Har­ry had bet­ter go first, with…”

She looked in­quir­ing­ly at one of the Au­rors, who nod­ded briefly, seized Har­ry’s up­per arm, and at­tempt­ed to steer him to­ward the bar­ri­er be­tween plat­forms nine and ten.

“I can walk, thanks,” said Har­ry ir­ri­ta­bly, jerk­ing his arm out of the Au­ror’s grip. He pushed his trol­ley di­rect­ly at the sol­id bar­ri­er, ig­nor­ing his silent com­pan­ion, and found him­self, a sec­ond lat­er, stand­ing on plat­form nine and three­quar­ters, where the scar­let Hog­warts Ex­press stood belch­ing steam over the crowd.

Hermione and the Weasleys joined him with­in sec­onds. With­out wait­ing to con­sult his grim­faced Au­ror, Har­ry mo­tioned to Ron and Hermione to fol­low him up the plat­form, look­ing for an emp­ty com­part­ment.

“We can’t, Har­ry,” said Hermione, look­ing apo­lo­get­ic. “Ron and I’ve got to go to the pre­fects’ car­riage first and then pa­trol the cor­ri­dors for a bit.”

“Oh yeah, I for­got,” said Har­ry.

“You’d bet­ter get straight on the train, all of you, you’ve on­ly got a few min­utes to go,” said Mrs. Weasley, con­sult­ing her watch. “Well, have a love­ly term, Ron…”

“Mr. Weasley, can I have a quick word?” said Har­ry, mak­ing up his mind on the spur of the mo­ment.

“Of course,” said Mr. Weasley, who looked slight­ly sur­prised, but fol­lowed Har­ry out of earshot of the oth­ers nev­er­the­less.

Har­ry had thought it through care­ful­ly and come to the con­clu­sion that, if he was to tell any­one, Mr. Weasley was the right per­son; first­ly, be­cause he worked at the Min­istry and was there­fore in the best po­si­tion to make fur­ther in­ves­ti­ga­tions, and sec­ond­ly,

be­cause he thought that there was not too much risk of Mr. Weasley ex­plod­ing with anger.

He could see Mrs. Weasley and the grim­faced Au­ror cast­ing the pair of them sus­pi­cious looks as they moved away.

“When we were in Di­agon Al­ley,” Har­ry be­gan, but Mr. Weasley fore­stalled him with a gri­mace.

“Am I about to dis­cov­er where you, Ron, and Hermione dis­ap­peared to while you were sup­posed to be in the back room of Fred and George’s shop?”

“How did you…?”

“Har­ry, please. You’re talk­ing to the man who raised Fred and George.”

“Er… yeah, all right, we weren’t in the back room.” “Very well, then, let’s hear the worst.”

“Well, we fol­lowed Dra­co Mal­foy. We used my In­vis­ibil­ity Cloak.”

“Did you have any par­tic­ular rea­son for do­ing so, or was it a mere whim?”

“Be­cause I thought Mal­foy was up to some­thing,” said Har­ry, dis­re­gard­ing Mr. Weasley’s look of min­gled ex­as­per­ation and amuse­ment. “He’d giv­en his moth­er the slip and I want­ed to know why.”

“Of course you did,” said Mr. Weasley, sound­ing re­signed. “Well? Did you find out why?”

“He went in­to Bor­gin and Burkes,” said Har­ry, “and start­ed bul­ly­ing the bloke in there, Bor­gin, to help him fix some­thing. And he said he want­ed Bor­gin to keep some­thing else for him. He made it sound like it was the same kind of thing that need­ed fix­ing. Like they were a pair. And…”

Har­ry took a deep breath.

“There’s some­thing else. We saw Mal­foy jump about a mile when Madam Malkin tried to touch his left arm. I think he’s been brand­ed with the Dark Mark. 1 think he’s re­placed his fa­ther as a Death Eater.”

Mr. Weasley looked tak­en aback. Af­ter a mo­ment he said, “Har­ry, I doubt whether YouKnowWho would al­low a six­teenyearold…”

“Does any­one re­al­ly know what YouKnowWho would or wouldn’t do?” asked Har­ry an­gri­ly. “Mr. Weasley, I’m sor­ry, but isn’t it worth in­ves­ti­gat­ing? If Mal­foy wants some­thing fix­ing, and he needs to threat­en Bor­gin to get it done, it’s prob­ably some­thing Dark or dan­ger­ous, isn’t it?”

“I doubt it, to be hon­est, Har­ry,” said Mr. Weasley slow­ly. “You see, when Lu­cius Mal­foy was ar­rest­ed, we raid­ed his house. We took away ev­ery­thing that might have been dan­ger­ous.” “I think you missed some­thing,” said Har­ry stub­born­ly. “Well, maybe,” said Mr. Weasley, but Har­ry could tell that Mr. Weasley was hu­mor­ing him.

There was a whis­tle be­hind them; near­ly ev­ery­one had board­ed the train and the doors were clos­ing.

“You’d bet­ter hur­ry!’ said Mr. Weasley, as Mrs. Weasley cried, “Har­ry, quick­ly!”

He hur­ried for­ward and Mr. and Mrs. Weasley helped him load his trunk on­to the train.

“Now, dear, you’re com­ing to us for Christ­mas, it’s all fixed with Dum­ble­dore, so we’ll see you quite soon,” said Mrs. Weasley through the win­dow, as Har­ry slammed the door shut be­hind him and the train be­gan to move. “You make sure you look af­ter your­self and…”

The train was gath­er­ing speed.

“…be good and…” , She was jog­ging to keep up now.

“…stay safe!”

Har­ry waved un­til the train had turned a cor­ner and Mr. and Mrs. Weasley were lost to view, then turned to see where the oth­ers had got to. He sup­posed Ron and Hermione were clois­tered in the pre­fects’ car­riage, but Gin­ny was a lit­tle way along the cor­ri­dor, chat­ting to some friends. He made his way to­ward her, drag­ging his trunk.

Peo­ple stared shame­less­ly as he ap­proached. They even pressed their faces against the win­dows of their com­part­ments to get a look at him. He had ex­pect­ed an up­swing in the amount of gap­ing and gaw­ping he would have to en­dure this term af­ter all the “Cho­sen One” ru­mors in the Dai­ly Prophet, but he did not en­joy the sen­sa­tion of stand­ing in a very bright spot­light. He tapped Gin­ny on the shoul­der.

“Fan­cy try­ing to find a com­part­ment?”

“I can’t, Har­ry, I said I’d meet Dean,” said Gin­ny bright­ly. “See you lat­er.”

“Right,” said Har­ry. He felt a strange twinge of an­noy­an­ce as she walked away, her long red hair danc­ing be­hind her; he had be­come so used to her pres­ence over the sum­mer that he had al­most for­got­ten that Gin­ny did not hang around with him, Ron, and Hermione while at school. Then he blinked and looked around: He was sur­round­ed by mes­mer­ized girls.

“Hi, Har­ry!” said a fa­mil­iar voice from be­hind him.

“Neville!” said Har­ry in re­lief, turn­ing to see a round­faced boy strug­gling to­ward him.

“Hel­lo, Har­ry,” said a girl with long hair and large misty eyes, who was just be­hind Neville.

“Lu­na, hi, how are you?”

“Very well, thank you,” said Lu­na. She was clutch­ing a mag­azine to her chest; large let­ters on the front an­nounced that there was a pair of free Spec­tre­specs in­side.

“Quib­bler still go­ing strong, then?” asked Har­ry, who felt a cer­tain fond­ness for the mag­azine, hav­ing giv­en it an ex­clu­sive in­ter­view the pre­vi­ous year.

“Oh yes, cir­cu­la­tion’s well up,” said Lu­na hap­pi­ly.

“Let’s find seats,” said Har­ry, and the three of them set off along the train through hordes of silent­ly star­ing stu­dents. At last they found an emp­ty com­part­ment, and Har­ry hur­ried in­side grate­ful­ly.

“They’re even star­ing at us? said Neville, in­di­cat­ing him­self and Lu­na. “Be­cause we’re with you!”

“They’re star­ing at you be­cause you were at the Min­istry too,” said Har­ry, as he hoist­ed his trunk in­to the lug­gage rack. “Our lit­tle ad­ven­ture there was all over the Dai­ly Prophet, you must’ve

seen it.”

“Yes, I thought Gran would be an­gry about all the pub­lic­ity,” said Neville, “but she was re­al­ly pleased. Says I’m start­ing to live up to my dad at long last. She bought me a new wand, look!”

He pulled it out and showed it to Har­ry.

“Cher­ry and uni­corn hair,” he said proud­ly. “We think it was one of the last Ol­li­van­der ev­er sold, he van­ished next day … oi, come back here, Trevor!”

And he dived un­der the seat to re­trieve his toad as it made one of its fre­quent bids for free­dom.

“Are we still do­ing D.A. meet­in­gs this year, Har­ry?” asked Lu­na,

who was de­tach­ing a pair of psychedel­ic spec­ta­cles from the mid­dle of The Quib­bler.

“No point now we’ve got rid of Um­bridge, is there?” said Har­ry, sit­ting down. Neville bumped his head against the seat as he emerged from un­der it. He looked most dis­ap­point­ed.

“I liked the D.A.! I learned loads with you!”

“I en­joyed the meet­in­gs too,” said Lu­na serene­ly. “It was like hav­ing friends.”

This was one of those un­com­fort­able things Lu­na of­ten said and which made Har­ry feel a squirm­ing mix­ture of pity and em­bar­rass­ment. Be­fore he could re­spond, how­ev­er, there was a dis­tur­bance out­side their com­part­ment door; a group of fourthyear girls was whis­per­ing and gig­gling to­geth­er on the oth­er side of the glass.

“You ask him!”

No, you!

“I’ll do it!”

And one of them, a bold­look­ing girl with large dark eyes, a pro­mi­nent chin, and long black hair pushed her way through the door.

“Hi, Har­ry, I’m Romil­da, Romil­da Vane,” she said loud­ly and con­fi­dent­ly. “Why don’t you join us in our com­part­ment? You don’t have to sit with them,” she added in a stage whis­per, in­di­cat­ing Neville’s bot­tom, which was stick­ing out from un­der the seat again as he groped around for Trevor, and Lu­na, who was now wear­ing her free Spec­tre­specs, which gave her the look of a de­ment­ed, mul­ti­col­ored owl.

“They’re friends of mine,” said Har­ry cold­ly.

“Oh,” said the girl, look­ing very sur­prised. “Oh. Okay.”

And she with­drew, slid­ing the door closed be­hind her.

“Peo­ple ex­pect you 10 have cool­er friends than us,” said Lu­na, once again dis­play­ing her knack for em­bar­rass­ing hon­es­ty.

“You are cool,” said Har­ry short­ly. “None of them was at the Min­istry. They didn’t fight with me.”

“That’s a very nice thing to say,” beamed Lu­na. Then she pushed her Spec­tre­specs far­ther up her nose and set­tled down to read The

Quib­bler.

“We didn’t face him, though,” said Neville, emerg­ing from un­der the seat with fluff and dust in his hair and a re­signed­look­ing Trevor in his hand. “You did. You should hear my gran talk about you. ‘That Har­ry Pot­ter’s got more back­bone than the whole Min­istry of Mag­ic put to­geth­er!’ She’d give any­thing to have you as a grand­son…

Har­ry laughed un­com­fort­ably and changed the sub­ject to OWL. re­sults as soon as he could. While Neville re­cit­ed his grades and won­dered aloud whether he would be al­lowed to take a Trans­fig­ura­tion NEWT, with on­ly an “Ac­cept­able,” Har­ry watched him with­out re­al­ly lis­ten­ing.

Neville’s child­hood had been blight­ed by Volde­mort just as much as Har­ry’s had, but Neville had no idea how close he had come to hav­ing Har­ry’s des­tiny. The prophe­cy could have re­ferred to ei­ther of them, yet, for his own in­scrutable rea­sons, Volde­mort had cho­sen to be­lieve that Har­ry was the one meant.

Had Volde­mort cho­sen Neville, it would be Neville sit­ting op­po­site Har­ry bear­ing the light­ning­shaped scar and the weight of the prophe­cy… Or would it? Would Neville’s moth­er have died to save him, as Lily had died for Har­ry? Sure­ly she would… But what if she had been un­able to stand be­tween her son and Volde­mort? Would there then have been no “Cho­sen One” at all? An emp­ty seat where Neville now sat and a scar­less Har­ry who would have been kissed good­bye by his own moth­er, not Ron’s?

“You all right, Har­ry? You look fun­ny,” said Neville.

Har­ry start­ed. “Sor­ry … I …”

“Wrack­spurt got you?” asked Lu­na sym­pa­thet­ical­ly, peer­ing at Har­ry through her enor­mous col­ored spec­ta­cles.

“I… what?”

“A Wrack­spurt… They’re in­vis­ible. They float in through your ears and make your brain go fuzzy,” she said. “I thought I felt one zoom­ing around in here.”

She flapped her hands at thin air, as though beat­ing off large in­vis­ible moths. Har­ry and Neville caught each oth­er’s eyes and hasti­ly be­gan to talk of Quid­ditch.

The weath­er be­yond the train win­dows was as patchy as it had been all sum­mer; they passed through stretch­es of the chill­ing mist, then out in­to weak, clear sun­light. It was dur­ing one of the clear spells, when the sun was vis­ible al­most di­rect­ly over­head, that Ron and Hermione en­tered the com­part­ment at last.

“Wish the lunch trol­ley would hur­ry up, I’m starv­ing,” said Ron long­ing­ly, slump­ing in­to the seat be­side Har­ry and rub­bing his stom­ach. “Hi, Neville. Hi, Lu­na. Guess what?” he added, turn­ing to Har­ry. “Mal­foy s not do­ing pre­fect du­ty. He’s just sit­ting in his com­part­ment with the oth­er Slytherins, we saw him when we passed.”

Har­ry sat up straight, in­ter­est­ed. It was not like Mal­foy to pass up the chance to de­mon­strate his pow­er as pre­fect, which he had hap­pi­ly abused all the pre­vi­ous year.

“What did he do when he saw you?”

“The usu­al,” said Ron in­dif­fer­ent­ly, de­mon­strat­ing a rude hand

ges­ture. “Not like him, though, is it? Well… that is” — he did the hand ges­ture again — “but why isn’t he out there bul­ly­ing first years?

“Dun­no,” said Har­ry, but his mind was rac­ing. Didn’t this look as though Mal­foy had more im­por­tant things on his mind than bul­ly­ing younger stu­dents?

“Maybe he pre­ferred the In­quisi­to­ri­al Squad,” said Hermione. “Maybe be­ing a pre­fect seems a bit tame af­ter that.”

“I don’t think so,” said Har­ry. “I think he’s …”

But be­fore he could ex­pound on his the­ory, the com­part­ment door slid open again and a breath­less thirdyear girl stepped in­side.

“I’m sup­posed to de­liv­er these to Neville Long­bot­tom and Har­ry PPot­ter,” she fal­tered, as her eyes met Har­ry’s and she turned scar­let. She was hold­ing out two scrolls of parch­ment tied with vi­olet rib­bon. Per­plexed, Har­ry and Neville took the scroll ad­dressed to each of them and the girl stum­bled back out of the com­part­ment.

“What is it?” Ron de­mand­ed, as Har­ry un­rolled his.

“An in­vi­ta­tion,” said Har­ry.

Har­ry,

I would be de­light­ed if you would join me for a bite of lunch in com­part­ment C.

Sin­cere­ly, Ho­race

“But what does he want me for?” asked Neville ner­vous­ly, as though he was ex­pect­ing de­ten­tion.

“No idea,” said Har­ry, which was not en­tire­ly true, though he had no proof yet that his hunch was cor­rect. “Lis­ten,” he added, seized by a sud­den brain wave, “let’s go un­der the In­vis­ibil­ity Cloak, then we might get a good look at Mal­foy on the way, see what he’s up to.”

This idea, how­ev­er, came to noth­ing: The cor­ri­dors, which were packed with peo­ple on the look­out for the lunch trol­ley, were im­pos­si­ble to ne­go­ti­ate while wear­ing the cloak. Har­ry stowed it re­gret­ful­ly back in his bag, re­flect­ing that it would have been nice to wear it just to avoid all the star­ing, which seemed to have in­creased in in­ten­si­ty even since he had last walked down the train. Ev­ery now and then, stu­dents would hur­tle out of their com­part­ments to get a bet­ter look at him. The ex­cep­tion was Cho Chang, who dart­ed in­to her com­part­ment when she saw Har­ry com­ing. As Har­ry passed the win­dow, he saw her deep in de­ter­mined con­ver­sa­tion with her friend Ma­ri­et­ta, who was wear­ing a very thick lay­er of make­up that did not en­tire­ly ob­scure the odd for­ma­tion of pim­ples still etched across her face. Smirk­ing slight­ly, Har­ry pushed on.

When they reached com­part­ment C, they saw at once that they were not Slughorn’s on­ly in­vi­tees, al­though judg­ing by the en­thu­si­asm of Slughorn’s wel­come, Har­ry was the most warm­ly an­tic­ipat­ed.

“Har­ry, m’boy!” said Slughorn, jump­ing up at the sight of him so that his great vel­vet­cov­ered bel­ly seemed to fill all the re­main­ing space in the com­part­ment. His shiny bald head and great sil­very mus­tache gleamed as bright­ly in the sun­light as the gold­en

but­tons on his waist­coat. “Good to see you, good to see you! And you must be Mr. Long­bot­tom!”

Neville nod­ded, look­ing scared. At a ges­ture from Slughorn, they sat down op­po­site each oth­er in the on­ly two emp­ty seats, which were near­est the door. Har­ry glanced around at their fel­low guests. He rec­og­nized a Slytherin from their year, a tall black boy with high cheek­bones and long, slant­ing eyes; there were al­so two sev­en­thyear boys Har­ry did not know and, squashed in the cor­ner be­side Slughorn and look­ing as though she was not en­tire­ly sure how she had got there, Gin­ny.

“Now, do you know ev­ery­one?” Slughorn asked Har­ry and Neville. “Blaise Zabi­ni is in your year, of course –“

Zabi­ni did not make any sign of recog­ni­tion or greet­ing, nor did Har­ry or Neville: Gryffind­or and Slytherin stu­dents loathed each oth­er on prin­ci­ple.

“This is Cor­mac McLaggen, per­haps you’ve come across each oth­er … ? No?”

McLaggen, a large, wiry­haired youth, raised a hand, and Har­ry and Neville nod­ded back at him.

“… and this is Mar­cus Bel­by, I don’t know whether …?”

Bel­by, who was thin and ner­vous­look­ing, gave a strained smile.

“… and this charm­ing young la­dy tells me she knows you!” Slughorn fin­ished.

Gin­ny gri­maced at Har­ry and Neville from be­hind Slughorn’s back.

“Well now, this is most pleas­ant,” said Slughorn co­zi­ly. “A chance to get to know you all a lit­tle bet­ter. Here, take a nap­kin. I’ve packed my own lunch; the trol­ley, as I re­mem­ber it, is heavy on

licorice wands, and a poor old man’s di­ges­tive sys­tem isn’t quite up to such things… Pheas­ant, Bel­by?”

Bel­by start­ed and ac­cept­ed what looked like half a cold pheas­ant.

“I was just telling young Mar­cus here that I had the plea­sure of teach­ing his Un­cle Damo­cles,” Slughorn told Har­ry and Neville, now pass­ing around a bas­ket of rolls. “Out­stand­ing wiz­ard, out­stand­ing, and his Or­der of Mer­lin most wellde­served. Do you see much of your un­cle, Mar­cus?”

Un­for­tu­nate­ly, Bei­by had just tak­en a large mouth­ful of pheas­ant; in his haste to an­swer Slughorn he sw­al­lowed too fast, turned pur­ple, and be­gan to choke.

“Anap­neo,” said Slughorn calm­ly, point­ing his wand at Bel­by, whose air­way seemed to clear at once.

“Not… not much of him, no,” gasped Bel­by, his eyes stream­ing.

“Well, of course, I dare­say he’s busy,” said Slughorn, look­ing ques­tion­ing­ly at Bel­by. “I doubt he in­vent­ed the Wolfs­bane Po­tion with­out con­sid­er­able hard work!”

“I sup­pose…” said Bel­by, who seemed afraid to take an­oth­er bite of pheas­ant un­til he was sure that Slughorn had fin­ished with him. “Er… he and my dad don’t get on very well, you see, so I don’t re­al­ly know much about…”

His voice tailed away as Slughorn gave him a cold smile and turned to McLaggen in­stead.

“Now, you, Cor­mac,” said Slughorn, “I hap­pen to know you see a lot of your Un­cle Tiberius, be­cause he has a rather splen­did pic­ture of the two of you hunt­ing nog­tails in, I think, Nor­folk?”

“Oh, yeah, that was fun, that was,” said McLaggen. “We went with Bertie Hig­gs and Ru­fus Scrim­geour; this was be­fore he be­came Min­is­ter, ob­vi­ous­ly …”

“Ah, you know Bertie and Ru­fus too?” beamed Slughorn, now of­fer­ing around a small tray of pies; some­how, Bel­by was missed out. “Now tell me…”

It was as Har­ry had sus­pect­ed. Ev­ery­one here seemed to have been in­vit­ed be­cause they were con­nect­ed to some­body well­known or in­flu­en­tial… ev­ery­one ex­cept Gin­ny. Zabi­ni, who was in­ter­ro­gat­ed af­ter McLaggen, turned out to have a fa­mous­ly beau­ti­ful witch for a moth­er (from what Har­ry could make out, she had been mar­ried sev­en times, each of her hus­bands dy­ing mys­te­ri­ous­ly and leav­ing her mounds of gold). It was Neville’s turn next: This was a very un­com­fort­able ten min­utes, for Neville’s par­ents, well­known Au­rors, had been tor­tured in­to in­san­ity by Bel­la­trix Lestrange and a cou­ple of Death Eater cronies. At the end of Neville’s in­ter­view, Har­ry had the im­pres­sion that Slughorn was re­serv­ing judg­ment on Neville, yet to see whether he had any of his par­ents’ flair.

“And now,” said Slughorn, shift­ing mas­sive­ly in his seat with the air of a com­pere in­tro­duc­ing his star act. “Har­ry Pot­ter! Where to be­gin? I feel I bare­ly scratched the sur­face when we met over the sum­mer!” He con­tem­plat­ed Har­ry for a mo­ment as though he was a par­tic­ular­ly large and suc­cu­lent piece of pheas­ant, then said, “‘The Cho­sen One,’ they’re call­ing you now!”

Har­ry said noth­ing. Bel­by, McLaggen, and Zabi­ni were all star­ing at him.

“Of course,” said Slughorn, watch­ing Har­ry close­ly, “there have been ru­mors for years… I re­mem­ber when … well … af­ter that ter­ri­ble night … Lily … James … and you sur­vived … and the word was that you must have pow­ers be­yond the or­di­nary …”

Zabi­ni gave a tiny lit­tle cough that was clear­ly sup­posed to

in­di­cate amused skep­ti­cism. An an­gry voice burst out from be­hind Slughorn.

“Yeah, Zabi­ni, be­cause you’re so tal­ent­ed… at pos­ing…”

“Oh dear!” chuck­led Slughorn com­fort­ably, look­ing around at Gin­ny, who was glar­ing at Zabi­ni around Slughorn’s great bel­ly. “You want to be care­ful, Blaise! I saw this young la­dy per­form the most mar­velous Bat­Bo­gey Hex as I was pass­ing her car­riage! I wouldn’t cross her!”

Zabi­ni mere­ly looked con­temp­tu­ous.

“Any­way,” said Slughorn, turn­ing back to Har­ry. “Such ru­mors this sum­mer. Of course, one doesn’t know what to be­lieve, the Prophet has been known to print in­ac­cu­ra­cies, make mis­takes … but there seems lit­tle doubt, giv­en the num­ber of wit­ness­es, that there was quite a dis­tur­bance at the Min­istry and that you were there in the thick of it all!”

Har­ry, who could not see any way out of this with­out flat­ly ly­ing, nod­ded but still said noth­ing. Slughorn beamed at him.

“So mod­est, so mod­est, no won­der Dum­ble­dore is so fond … you were there, then? But the rest of the sto­ries … so sen­sa­tion­al, of course, one doesn’t know quite what to be­lieve … this fa­bled prophe­cy, for in­stance …”

“We nev­er heard a prophe­cy,” said Neville, turn­ing gera­ni­um pink as he said it.

“That’s right,” said Gin­ny staunch­ly. “Neville and I were both there too, and all this ‘Cho­sen One’ rub­bish is just the Prophet mak­ing things up as usu­al.”

“You were both there too, were you?” said Slughorn with great in­ter­est, look­ing from Gin­ny to Neville, but both of them sat clam­like be­fore his en­cour­ag­ing smile.

“Yes… well… it is true that the Prophet of­ten ex­ag­ger­ates, of course…” Slughorn said, sound­ing a lit­tle dis­ap­point­ed. “I re­mem­ber dear Gwenog telling me (Gwenog Jones, I mean, of course, Cap­tain of the Holy­head Harpies) …”

He me­an­dered off in­to a long­wind­ed rem­inis­cence, but Har­ry had the dis­tinct im­pres­sion that Slughorn had not fin­ished with him, and that he had not been con­vinced by Neville and Gin­ny.

The af­ter­noon wore on with more anec­dotes about il­lus­tri­ous wiz­ards Slughorn had taught, all of whom had been de­light­ed to join what he called the “Slug Club” at Hog­warts. Har­ry could not wait to leave, but couldn’t see how to do so po­lite­ly. Fi­nal­ly the train emerged from yet an­oth­er long misty stretch in­to a red sun­set, and Slughorn looked around, blink­ing in the twi­light.

“Good gra­cious, it’s get­ting dark al­ready! I didn’t no­tice that they’d lit the lamps! You’d bet­ter go and change in­to your robes, all of you. McLaggen, you must drop by and bor­row that book on nog­tails. Har­ry, Blaise … any time you’re pass­ing. Same goes for you, miss,” he twin­kled at Gin­ny. “Well, off you go, off you go!”

As he pushed past Har­ry in­to the dark­en­ing cor­ri­dor, Zabi­ni shot him a filthy look that Har­ry re­turned with in­ter­est. He, Gin­ny, and Neville fol­lowed Zabi­ni back along the train.

“I’m glad that’s over,” mut­tered Neville. “Strange man, isn’t he?” “Yeah, he is a bit,” said Har­ry, his eyes on Zabi­ni. “How come you end­ed up in there, Gin­ny?”

“He saw me hex Zacharias Smith,” said Gin­ny. “You re­mem­ber that id­iot from Huf­flepuff who was in the D.A.? He kept on and on ask­ing about what hap­pened at the Min­istry and in the end he an­noyed me so much I hexed him … when Slughorn came in I thought I was go­ing to got de­ten­tion, but he just thought it was ;i re­al­ly good hex and in­vit­ed me to lunch! Mad, eh?”

“Bet­ter rea­son for in­vit­ing some­one than be­cause their moth­er’s fa­mous,” said Har­ry, scowl­ing at the back of Zabi­ni’s head, “or be­cause their un­cle…”

But he broke off. An idea had just oc­curred to him, a reck­less but po­ten­tial­ly won­der­ful idea… In a minute’s time, Zabi­ni was go­ing to reen­ter the Slytherin six­thyear com­part­ment and Mal­foy would be sit­ting there, think­ing him­self un­heard by any­body ex­cept fel­low Slytherins… If Har­ry could on­ly en­ter, un­seen, be­hind him, what might he not see or hear? True, there was lit­tle of the jour­ney left … Hogsmeade Sta­tion had to be less than half an hour away, judg­ing by the wild­ness of the scenery flash­ing by the win­dows … but no­body else seemed pre­pared to take Har­ry’s sus­pi­cions se­ri­ous­ly, so it was down to him to prove them.

“I’ll see you two lat­er,” said Har­ry un­der his breath, pulling out his In­vis­ibil­ity Cloak and fling­ing it over him­self.

“But what’re you … ?” asked Neville.

“Lat­er!” whis­pered Har­ry, dart­ing af­ter Zabi­ni as qui­et­ly as pos­si­ble, though the rat­tling of the train made such cau­tion al­most point­less.

The cor­ri­dors were al­most com­plete­ly emp­ty now. Near­ly ev­ery­one had re­turned to their car­riages to change in­to their school robes and pack up their pos­ses­sions. Though he was as close as he could get to Zabi­ni with­out touch­ing him, Har­ry was not quick enough to slip in­to the com­part­ment when Zabi­ni opened the door. Zabi­ni was al­ready slid­ing it shut when Har­ry hasti­ly stuck out his foot to pre­vent it clos­ing.

“What’s wrong with this thing?” said Zabi­ni an­gri­ly as he smashed the slid­ing door re­peat­ed­ly in­to Har­ry’s foot.

Har­ry seized the door and pushed it open, hard; Zabi­ni, still cling­ing on to the han­dle, top­pled over side­ways in­to Gre­go­ry Goyle’s lap, and in the en­su­ing ruckus, Har­ry dart­ed in­to the com­part­ment, leapt on­to Zabi­ni’s tem­po­rar­ily emp­ty seat, and hoist­ed him­self up in­to the lug­gage rack. It was for­tu­nate that Goyle and Zabi­ni were snarling at each oth­er, draw­ing all eyes on­to them, for Har­ry was quite sure his feet and an­kles had been re­vealed as the cloak had flapped around them; in­deed, for one hor­ri­ble mo­ment he thought he saw Mal­foy’s eyes fol­low his train­er as it whipped up­ward out of sight. But then Goyle slammed the door shut and flung Zabi­ni off him; Zabi­ni col­lapsed in­to his own seat look­ing ruf­fled, Vin­cent Crabbe re­turned to his com­ic, and Mal­foy, snig­ger­ing, lay back down across two seats with his head in Pan­sy Parkin­sons lap. Har­ry lay curled un­com­fort­ably un­der the cloak to en­sure that ev­ery inch of him re­mained hid­den, and watched Pan­sy stroke the sleek blond hair off Mal­foy’s fore­head, smirk­ing as she did so, as though any­one would have loved to have been in her place. The lanterns swing­ing from the car­riage ceil­ing cast a bright light over the scene: Har­ry could read ev­ery word of Crabbe’s com­ic di­rect­ly

be­low him.

“So, Zabi­ni,” said Mal­foy, “what did Slughorn want?”

“Just try­ing to make up to well­con­nect­ed peo­ple,” said Zabi­ni,

who was still glow­er­ing at Goyle. “Not that he man­aged to find

many.”

This in­for­ma­tion did not seem to please Mal­foy. “Who else had he in­vit­ed?” he de­mand­ed.

“McLaggen from Gryffind­or,” said Zabi­ni.

“Oh yeah, his un­cle’s big in the Min­istry,” said Mal­foy.

“… some­one else called Bel­by, from Raven­claw …”

“Not him, he’s a prat!” said Pan­sy.

“… and Long­bot­tom, Pot­ter, and that Weasley girl,” fin­ished Zabi­ni.

Mal­foy sat up very sud­den­ly, knock­ing Pan­sy’s hand aside.

“He in­vit­ed Long­bot­tom?.”

“Well, I as­sume so, as Long­bot­tom was there,” said Zabi­ni in­dif­fer­ent­ly.

“What’s Long­bot­tom got to in­ter­est Slughorn?”

Zabi­ni shrugged.

“Pot­ter, pre­cious Pot­ter, ob­vi­ous­ly he want­ed a look at ‘the Cho­sen One,’” sneered Mal­foy, “but that Weasley girl! What’s so spe­cial about her?”

“A lot of boys like her,” said Pan­sy, watch­ing Mal­foy out of the cor­ner of her eyes for his re­ac­tion. “Even you think she’s good­look­ing, don’t you, Blaise, and we all know how hard you are to please!

“I wouldn’t touch a filthy lit­tle blood traitor like her what­ev­er she looked like,” said Zabi­ni cold­ly, and Pan­sy looked pleased. Mal­foy sank back across her lap and al­lowed her to re­sume the stroking of his hair.

“Well, I pity Slughorn’s taste. Maybe he’s go­ing a bit se­nile. Shame, my fa­ther al­ways said he was a good wiz­ard in his day. My fa­ther used to be a bit of a fa­vorite of his. Slughorn prob­ably hasn’t heard I’m on the train, or…”

“I wouldn’t bank on an in­vi­ta­tion,” said Zabi­ni. “He asked me about Notts fa­ther when I first ar­rived. They used to be old

friends, ap­par­ent­ly, but when he heard he’d been caught at the Min­istry he didn’t look hap­py, and Nott didn’t get an in­vi­ta­tion, did he? 1 don’t think Slughorn’s in­ter­est­ed in Death Eaters.”

Mal­foy looked an­gry, but forced out a sin­gu­lar­ly hu­mor­less laugh.

“Well, who cares what he’s in­ter­est­ed in? What is he, when you come down to it? Just some stupid teach­er.” Mal­foy yawned os­ten­ta­tious­ly. “I mean, I might not even be at Hog­warts next year, what’s it mat­ter to me if some fat old has­been likes me or not?”

“What do you mean, you might not be at Hog­warts next year?” said Pan­sy in­dig­nant­ly, ceas­ing groom­ing Mal­foy at once.

“Well, you nev­er know,” said Mal­foy with the ghost of a smirk. “I might have … er … moved on to big­ger and bet­ter things.”

Crouched in the lug­gage rack un­der his cloak, Har­ry’s heart be­gan to race. What would Ron and Hermione say about this? Crabbe and Goyle were gaw­ping at Mal­foy; ap­par­ent­ly they had had no inkling of any plans to move on to big­ger and bet­ter things. Even Zabi­ni had al­lowed a look of cu­rios­ity to mar his haughty fea­tures. Pan­sy re­sumed the slow stroking of Mal­foy s hair, look­ing dumb­found­ed.

“Do you mean…”

Mal­foy shrugged.

“Moth­er wants me to com­plete my ed­uca­tion, but per­son­al­ly, I don’t see it as that im­por­tant these days. I mean, think about it… When the Dark Lord takes over, is he go­ing to care how many OWLs or N.E.W.T.S any­one’s got? Of course he isn’t. It’ll be all about the kind of ser­vice he re­ceived, the lev­el of de­vo­tion he was shown.”

“And you think you’ll be able to do some­thing for him?” asked

Zabi­ni scathing­ly. “Six­teen years old and noi even ful­ly qual­ified yet?”

“I’ve just said, haven’t I? Maybe he doesn’t care if I’m qual­ified. Maybe the job he wants me to do isn’t some­thing that you need to be qual­ified for,” said Mal­foy qui­et­ly.

Crabbe and Goyle were both sit­ting with their mouths open like gar­goyles. Pan­sy was gaz­ing down at Mal­foy as though she had nev­er seen any­thing so awein­spir­ing.

“I can see Hog­warts,” said Mal­foy, clear­ly rel­ish­ing the ef­fect he had cre­at­ed as he point­ed out of the black­ened win­dow. “We’d bet­ter get our robes on.”

Har­ry was so busy star­ing at Mal­foy, he did not no­tice Goyle reach­ing up for his trunk; as he swung it down, it hit Har­ry hard on the side of the head. He let out an in­vol­un­tary gasp of pain, and Mal­foy looked up at the lug­gage rack, frown­ing.

Har­ry was not afraid of Mal­foy, but he still did not much like the idea of be­ing dis­cov­ered hid­ing un­der his In­vis­ibil­ity Cloak by a group of un­friend­ly Slytherins. Eyes still wa­ter­ing and head still throb­bing, he drew his wand, care­ful not to dis­ar­range the cloak, and wait­ed, breath held. To his re­lief, Mal­foy seemed to de­cide that he had imag­in­ed the noise; he pulled on his robes like the oth­ers, locked his trunk, and as the train slowed to a jerky crawl, fas­tened a thick new trav­el­ing cloak round his neck.

Har­ry could see the cor­ri­dors fill­ing up again and hoped that Hermione and Ron would take his things out on­to the plat­form for him; he was stuck where he was un­til the com­part­ment had quite emp­tied. At last, with a fi­nal lurch, the train came to a com­plete halt. Goyle threw the door open and mus­cled his way out

in­to a crowd of sec­ond years, punch­ing them aside; Crabbe and Zabi­ni fol­lowed.

“You go on,” Mal­foy told Pan­sy, who was wait­ing for him with her hand held out as though hop­ing he would hold it. “I just want to check some­thing.”

Pan­sy left. Now Har­ry and Mal­foy were alone in the com­part­ment. Peo­ple were fil­ing past, de­scend­ing on­to the dark plat­form. Mal­foy moved over to the com­part­ment door and let down the blinds, so that peo­ple in the cor­ri­dor be­yond could not peer in. He then bent down over his trunk and opened it again.

Har­ry peered down over the edge of the lug­gage rack, his heart pump­ing a lit­tle faster. What had Mal­foy want­ed to hide from Pan­sy? Was he about to see the mys­te­ri­ous bro­ken ob­ject it was so im­por­tant to mend?

“Pet­ri­fi­cus To­talus!”

With­out warn­ing, Mal­foy point­ed his wand at Har­ry, who was in­stant­ly par­alyzed. As though in slow mo­tion, he top­pled out of the lug­gage rack and fell, with an ag­oniz­ing, floor­shak­ing crash, at Mal­foy’s feet, the In­vis­ibil­ity Cloak trapped be­neath him, his whole body re­vealed with his legs still curled ab­surd­ly in­to the cramped kneel­ing po­si­tion. He couldn’t move a mus­cle; he could on­ly gaze up at Mal­foy, who smiled broad­ly.

“I thought so,” he said ju­bi­lant­ly. “I heard Goyle’s trunk hit you. And I thought I saw some­thing white flash through the air af­ter Zabi­ni came back…”

His eyes lin­gered for a mo­ment up­on Har­ry’s train­ers.

“You didn’t hear any­thing I care about, Pot­ter. But while I’ve got you here…”

And he stamped, hard, on Har­ry’s face. Har­ry felt his nose break; blood spurt­ed ev­ery­where.

“That’s from my fa­ther. Now, let’s see…”

Mal­foy dragged the cloak out from un­der Har­ry’s im­mo­bi­lized body and threw it over him.

“I don’t reck­on they’ll find you till the trains back in Lon­don,” he said qui­et­ly. “See you around, Pot­ter… or not.”

And tak­ing care to tread on Har­ry’s fin­gers, Mal­foy left the com­part­ment.
