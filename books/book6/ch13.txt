Chapter 13: The Secret Riddle


Katie was re­moved to St. Mun­go’s Hos­pi­tal for Mag­ical Mal­adies and In­ju­ries the fol­low­ing day, by which time the news that she had been cursed had spread all over the school, though the de­tails were con­fused and no­body oth­er than Har­ry, Ron, Hermione, and Leanne seemed to know that Katie her­self had not been the in­tend­ed tar­get.

“Oh, and Mal­foy knows, of course,” said Har­ry to Ron and Hermione, who con­tin­ued their new pol­icy of feign­ing deaf­ness when­ev­er Har­ry men­tioned his Mal­foy­IsaDeathE­ater the­ory.

Har­ry had won­dered whether Dum­ble­dore would re­turn from wher­ev­er he had been in time for Mon­day night’s les­son, but hav­ing had no word to the con­trary, he pre­sent­ed him­self out­side Dum­ble­dore’s of­fice at eight o’clock, knocked, and was told to en­ter. There sat Dum­ble­dore look­ing un­usu­al­ly tired; his hand was as black and burned as ev­er, but he smiled when he ges­tured to Har­ry to sit down. The Pen­sieve was sit­ting on the desk again, cast­ing sil­very specks of light over the ceil­ing.

“You have had a busy time while I have been away,” Dum­ble­dore said. “I be­lieve you wit­nessed Katie’s ac­ci­dent.”

“Yes, sir. How is she?”

“Still very un­well, al­though she was rel­ative­ly lucky. She ap­pears to have brushed the neck­lace with the small­est pos­si­ble amount of skin; there was a tiny hole in her glove. Had she put it on, had she even held it in her un­gloved hand, she would have died, per­haps in­stant­ly. Luck­ily Pro­fes­sor Snape was able to do enough to pre­vent a rapid spread of the curse —”

“Why him?” asked Har­ry quick­ly. “Why not Madam Pom­frey?”

“Im­per­ti­nent,” said a soft voice from one of the por­traits on the wall, and Phineas Nigel­lus Black, Sir­ius’s great­great­grand­fa­ther, raised his head from his arms where he had ap­peared to be sleep­ing. “I would not have per­mit­ted a stu­dent to ques­tion the way Hog­warts op­er­at­ed in my day.”

“Yes, thank you, Phineas,” said Dum­ble­dore quelling­ly. “Pro­fes­sor Snape knows much more about the Dark Arts than Madam Pom­frey, Har­ry. Any­way, the St. Mun­go’s staff are send­ing me hourly re­ports, and I am hope­ful that Katie will make a full re­cov­ery in time.”

“Where were you this week­end, sir?” Har­ry asked, dis­re­gard­ing a strong feel­ing that he might be push­ing his luck, a feel­ing ap­par­ent­ly shared by Phineas Nigel­lus, who hissed soft­ly.

“I would rather not say just now,” said Dum­ble­dore. “How­ev­er, I shall tell you in due course.”

“You will?” said Har­ry, star­tled.

“Yes, I ex­pect so,” said Dum­ble­dore, with­draw­ing a fresh bot­tle of sil­ver mem­ories from in­side his robes and un­cork­ing it with a prod of his wand.

“Sir,” said Har­ry ten­ta­tive­ly, “I met Mundun­gus in Hogsmeade.”

“Ah yes, I am al­ready aware that Mundun­gus has been treat­ing your in­her­itance with lightfin­gered con­tempt,” said Dum­ble­dore, frown­ing a lit­tle. “He has gone to ground since you ac­cost­ed him out­side the Three Broom­sticks; I rather think he dreads fac­ing me. How­ev­er, rest as­sured that he will not be mak­ing away with any more of Sir­ius’s old pos­ses­sions.”

“That mangy old half­blood has been steal­ing Black heir­looms?” said Phineas Nigel­lus, in­censed; and he stalked out of his frame, un­doubt­ed­ly to vis­it his por­trait in num­ber twelve, Grim­mauld Place.

“Pro­fes­sor,” said Har­ry, af­ter a short pause, “did Pro­fes­sor McG­ona­gall tell you what I told her af­ter Katie got hurt? About Dra­co Mal­foy?”

“She told me of your sus­pi­cions, yes,” said Dum­ble­dore.

“And do you — ?”

“I shall take all ap­pro­pri­ate mea­sures to in­ves­ti­gate any­one who might have had a hand in Katie’s ac­ci­dent,” said Dum­ble­dore. “But what con­cerns me now, Har­ry, is our les­son.”

Har­ry felt slight­ly re­sent­ful at this: If their lessons were so very im­por­tant, why had there been such a long gap be­tween the first and sec­ond? How­ev­er, he said no more about Dra­co Mal­foy, but watched as Dum­ble­dore poured the fresh mem­ories in­to the Pen­sieve and be­gan swirling the stone basin once more be­tween his longfin­gered hands.

“You will re­mem­ber, I am sure, that we left the tale of Lord Volde­mort’s be­gin­nings at the point where the hand­some Mug­gle, Tom Rid­dle, had aban­doned his witch wife, Merope, and re­turned to his fam­ily home in Lit­tle Hangle­ton. Merope was left alone in Lon­don, ex­pect­ing the ba­by who would one day be­come Lord Volde­mort.”

“How do you know she was in Lon­don, sir?”

“Be­cause of the ev­idence of one Car­ac­ta­cus Burke,” said Dum­ble­dore, “who, by an odd co­in­ci­dence, helped found the very shop whence came the neck­lace we have just been dis­cussing.”

He swilled the con­tents of the Pen­sieve as Har­ry had seen him swill them be­fore, much as a gold prospec­tor sifts for gold. Up out of the swirling, sil­very mass rose a lit­tle old man re­volv­ing slow­ly in the Pen­sieve, sil­ver as a ghost but much more sol­id, with a thatch of hair that com­plete­ly cov­ered his eyes.

“Yes, we ac­quired it in cu­ri­ous cir­cum­stances. It was brought in by a young witch just be­fore Christ­mas, oh, many years ago now. She said she need­ed the gold bad­ly, well, that much was ob­vi­ous. Cov­ered in rags and pret­ty far along . . . Go­ing to have a ba­by, see. She said the lock­et had been Slytherin’s. Well, we hear that sort of sto­ry all the time, ‘Oh, this was Mer­lin’s, this was, his fa­vorite teapot,’ but when I looked at it, it had his mark all right, and a few sim­ple spells were enough to tell me the truth. Of course, that made it near enough price­less. She didn’t seem to have any idea how much it was worth. Hap­py to get ten Galleons for it. Best bar­gain we ev­er made!”

Dum­ble­dore gave the Pen­sieve an ex­trav­ig­or­ous shake and Car­ac­ta­cus Burke de­scend­ed back in­to the swirling mass of mem­ory from whence he had come.

“He on­ly gave her ten Galleons?” said Har­ry in­dig­nant­ly.

“Car­ac­ta­cus Burke was not famed for his gen­eros­ity,” said Dum­ble­dore. “So we know that, near the end of her preg­nan­cy, Merope was alone in Lon­don and in des­per­ate need of gold, des­per­ate enough to sell her one and on­ly valu­able pos­ses­sion, the lock­et that was one of Mar­vo­lo’s trea­sured fam­ily heir­looms.”

“But she could do mag­ic!” said Har­ry im­pa­tient­ly. “She could have got food and ev­ery­thing for her­self by mag­ic, couldn’t she?”

“Ah,” said Dum­ble­dore, “per­haps she could. But it is my be­lief—I am guess­ing again, but I am sure I am right — that when her hus­band aban­doned her, Merope stopped us­ing mag­ic. I do not think that she want­ed to be a witch any longer. Of course, it is al­so pos­si­ble that her un­re­quit­ed love and the at­ten­dant de­spair sapped her of her pow­ers; that can hap­pen. In any case, as you are about to see, Merope re­fused to raise her wand even to save her own life.”

“She wouldn’t even stay alive for her son?”

Dum­ble­dore raised his eye­brows. “Could you pos­si­bly be feel­ing sor­ry for Lord Volde­mort?”

“No,” said Har­ry quick­ly, “but she had a choice, didn’t she, not like my moth­er —”

“Your moth­er had a choice too,” said Dum­ble­dore gen­tly. “Yes, Merope Rid­dle chose death in spite of a son who need­ed her, but do not judge her too harsh­ly, Har­ry. She was great­ly weak­ened by long suf­fer­ing and she nev­er had your moth­er’s courage. And now, if you will stand …”

“Where are we go­ing?” Har­ry asked, as Dum­ble­dore joined him at the front of the desk.

“This time,” said Dum­ble­dore, “we are go­ing to en­ter my mem­ory. I think you will find it both rich in de­tail and sat­is­fy­ing­ly ac­cu­rate. Af­ter you, Har­ry …”

Har­ry bent over the Pen­sieve; his face broke the cool sur­face of the mem­ory and then he was falling through dark­ness again. . . . Sec­onds lat­er, his feet hit firm ground; he opened his eyes and found that he and Dum­ble­dore were stand­ing in a bustling, old­fash­ioned Lon­don street.

“There I am,” said Dum­ble­dore bright­ly, point­ing ahead of them to a tall fig­ure cross­ing the road in front of a horse­drawn milk cart.

This younger Al­bus Dum­ble­dore’s long hair and beard were auburn. Hav­ing reached their side of the street, he strode off along the pave­ment, draw­ing many cu­ri­ous glances due to the flam­boy­ant­ly cut suit of plum vel­vet that he was wear­ing.

“Nice suit, sir,” said Har­ry, be­fore he could stop him­self, but Dum­ble­dore mere­ly chuck­led as they fol­lowed his younger self a short dis­tance, fi­nal­ly pass­ing through a set of iron gates in­to a bare court­yard that front­ed a rather grim, square build­ing sur­round­ed by high rail­in­gs. He mount­ed the few steps lead­ing to the front door and knocked once. Af­ter a mo­ment or two, the door was opened by a scruffy girl wear­ing an apron.

“Good af­ter­noon. I have an ap­point­ment with a Mrs. Cole, who, I be­lieve, is the ma­tron here?”

“Oh,” said the be­wil­dered­look­ing girl, tak­ing in Dum­ble­dore’s ec­cen­tric ap­pear­an­ce. “Um. . . just a mo’ . . . MRS. COLE!” she bel­lowed over her shoul­der.

Har­ry heard a dis­tant voice shout­ing some­thing in re­sponse. The girl turned back to Dum­ble­dore. “Come in, she’s on ‘er way.”

Dum­ble­dore stepped in­to a hall­way tiled in black and white; the whole place was shab­by but spot­less­ly clean. Har­ry and the old­er Dum­ble­dore fol­lowed. Be­fore the front door had closed be­hind them, a skin­ny, ha­rass­ed­look­ing wom­an came scur­ry­ing to­ward them. She had a sharpfea­tured face that ap­peared more anx­ious than un­kind, and she was talk­ing over her shoul­der to an­oth­er aproned helper as she walked to­ward Dum­ble­dore.

“. . . and take the io­dine up­stairs to Martha, Bil­ly Stubbs has been pick­ing his scabs and Er­ic Whal­ley’s ooz­ing all over his sheets — chick­en pox on top of ev­ery­thing else,” she said to no­body in par­tic­ular, and then her eyes fell up­on Dum­ble­dore and she stopped dead in her tracks, look­ing as as­ton­ished as if a gi­raffe had just crossed her thresh­old.

“Good af­ter­noon,” said Dum­ble­dore, hold­ing out his hand. Mrs. Cole sim­ply gaped.

“My name is Al­bus Dum­ble­dore. I sent you a let­ter re­quest­ing an ap­point­ment and you very kind­ly in­vit­ed me here to­day.”

Mrs. Cole blinked. Ap­par­ent­ly de­cid­ing that Dum­ble­dore was not a hal­lu­ci­na­tion, she said fee­bly, “Oh yes. Well — well then — you’d bet­ter come in­to my room. Yes.”

She led Dum­ble­dore in­to a small room that seemed part sit­ting room, part of­fice. It was as shab­by as the hall­way and the fur­ni­ture was old and mis­matched. She in­vit­ed Dum­ble­dore to sit on a rick­ety chair and seat­ed her­self be­hind a clut­tered desk, eye­ing him ner­vous­ly.

“I am here, as I told you in my let­ter, to dis­cuss Tom Rid­dle and ar­range­ments for his fu­ture,” said Dum­ble­dore.

“Are you fam­ily?” asked Mrs. Cole.

“No, I am a teach­er,” said Dum­ble­dore. “I have come to of­fer Tom a place at my school.”

“What school’s this, then?”

“It is called Hog­warts,” said Dum­ble­dore.

“And how come you’re in­ter­est­ed in Tom?”

“We be­lieve he has qual­ities we are look­ing for.”

“You mean he’s won a schol­ar­ship? How can he have done? He’s nev­er been en­tered for one.”

“Well, his name has been down for our school since birth —”

“Who reg­is­tered him? His par­ents?”

There was no doubt that Mrs. Cole was an in­con­ve­nient­ly sharp wom­an. Ap­par­ent­ly Dum­ble­dore thought so too, for Har­ry now saw him slip his wand out of the pock­et of his vel­vet suit, at the same time pick­ing up a piece of per­fect­ly blank pa­per from Mrs. Cole’s desk­top.

“Here,” said Dum­ble­dore, wav­ing his wand once as he passed her the piece of pa­per, “I think this will make ev­ery­thing clear.”

Mrs. Cole’s eyes slid out of fo­cus and back again as she gazed in­tent­ly at the blank pa­per for a mo­ment.

“That seems per­fect­ly in or­der,” she said placid­ly, hand­ing it back. Then her eyes fell up­on a bot­tle of gin and two glass­es that had cer­tain­ly not been present a few sec­onds be­fore.

“Er — may I of­fer you a glass of gin?” she said in an ex­trare­fined voice.

“Thank you very much,” said Dum­ble­dore, beam­ing.

It soon be­came clear that Mrs. Cole was no novice when it came to gin drink­ing. Pour­ing both of them a gen­er­ous mea­sure, she drained her own glass in one gulp. Smack­ing her lips frankly, she smiled at Dum­ble­dore for the first time, and he didn’t hes­itate to press his ad­van­tage.

“I was won­der­ing whether you could tell me any­thing of Tom Rid­dle’s his­to­ry? I think he was born here in the or­phan­age?”

“That’s right,” said Mrs. Cole, help­ing her­self to more gin. “I re­mem­ber it clear as any­thing, be­cause I’d just start­ed here my­self. New Year’s Eve and bit­ter cold, snow­ing, you know. Nasty night. And this girl, not much old­er than I was my­self at the time, came stag­ger­ing up the front steps. Well, she wasn’t the first. We took her in, and she had the ba­by with­in the hour. And she was dead in an­oth­er hour.”

Mrs. Cole nod­ded im­pres­sive­ly and took an­oth­er gen­er­ous gulp of gin.

“Did she say any­thing be­fore she died?” asked Dum­ble­dore. “Any­thing about the boy’s fa­ther, for in­stance?”

“Now, as it hap­pens, she did,” said Mrs. Cole, who seemed to be rather en­joy­ing her­self now, with the gin in her hand and an ea­ger au­di­ence for her sto­ry. “I re­mem­ber she said to me, ‘I hope he looks like his pa­pa,’ and I won’t lie, she was right to hope it, be­cause she was no beau­ty — and then she told me he was to be named Tom, for his fa­ther, and Mar­vo­lo, for her fa­ther — yes, I know, fun­ny name, isn’t it? We won­dered whether she came from a cir­cus — and she said the boy’s sur­name was to be Rid­dle. And she died soon af­ter that with­out an­oth­er word.

“Well, we named him just as she’d said, it seemed so im­por­tant to the poor girl, but no Tom nor Mar­vo­lo nor any kind of Rid­dle ev­er came look­ing for him, nor any fam­ily at all, so he stayed in the or­phan­age and he’s been here ev­er since.”

Mrs. Cole helped her­self, al­most ab­sent­mind­ed­ly, to an­oth­er healthy mea­sure of gin. Two pink spots had ap­peared high on her cheek­bones. Then she said, “He’s a fun­ny boy.”

“Yes,” said Dum­ble­dore. “I thought he might be.”

“He was a fun­ny ba­by too. He hard­ly ev­er cried, you know. And then, when he got a lit­tle old­er, he was. . . odd.”

“Odd in what way?” asked Dum­ble­dore gen­tly.

“Well, he —”

But Mrs. Cole pulled up short, and there was noth­ing blur­ry or vague about the in­quisi­to­ri­al glance she shot Dum­ble­dore over her gin glass.

“He’s def­inite­ly got a place at your school, you say?”

“Def­inite­ly,” said Dum­ble­dore.

“And noth­ing I say can change that?”

“Noth­ing,” said Dum­ble­dore.

“You’ll be tak­ing him away, what­ev­er?”

“What­ev­er,” re­peat­ed Dum­ble­dore grave­ly.

She squint­ed at him as though de­cid­ing whether or not to trust him. Ap­par­ent­ly she de­cid­ed she could, be­cause she said in a sud­den rush, “He scares the oth­er chil­dren.”

“You mean he is a bul­ly?” asked Dum­ble­dore.

“I think he must be,” said Mrs. Cole, frown­ing slight­ly, “but it’s very hard to catch him at it. There have been in­ci­dents. . . . Nasty things …”

Dum­ble­dore did not press her, though Har­ry could tell that he was in­ter­est­ed. She took yet an­oth­er gulp of gin and her rosy cheeks grew rosier still.

“Bil­ly Stubbs’s rab­bit. . . well, Tom said he didn’t do it and I don’t see how he could have done, but even so, it didn’t hang it­self from the rafters, did it?”

“I shouldn’t think so, no,” said Dum­ble­dore qui­et­ly.

“But I’m jig­gered if I know how he got up there to do it. All I know is he and Bil­ly had ar­gued the day be­fore. And then” — Mrs. Cole took an­oth­er swig of gin, slop­ping a lit­tle over her chin this time — “on the sum­mer out­ing — we take them out, you know, once a year, to the coun­try­side or to the sea­side — well, Amy Ben­son and Den­nis Bish­op were nev­er quite right af­ter­wards, and all we ev­er got out of them was that they’d gone in­to a cave with Tom Rid­dle. He swore they’d just gone ex­plor­ing, but some­thing hap­pened in there, I’m sure of it. And, well, there have been a lot of things, fun­ny things. . . .”

She looked around at Dum­ble­dore again, and though her cheeks were flushed, her gaze was steady. “I don’t think many peo­ple will be sor­ry to see the back of him.”

“You un­der­stand, I’m sure, that we will not be keep­ing him per­ma­nent­ly?” said Dum­ble­dore. “He will have to re­turn here, at the very least, ev­ery sum­mer.”

“Oh, well, that’s bet­ter than a whack on the nose with a rusty pok­er,” said Mrs. Cole with a slight hic­cup. She got to her feet, and Har­ry was im­pressed to see that she was quite steady, even though twothirds of the gin was now gone. “I sup­pose you’d like to see him?”

“Very much,” said Dum­ble­dore, ris­ing too.

She led him out of her of­fice and up the stone stairs, call­ing out in­struc­tions and ad­mo­ni­tions to helpers and chil­dren as she passed. The or­phans, Har­ry saw, were all wear­ing the same kind of gray­ish tu­nic. They looked rea­son­ably well­cared for, but there was no de­ny­ing that this was a grim place in which to grow up.

“Here we are,” said Mrs. Cole, as they turned off the sec­ond land­ing and stopped out­side the first door in a long cor­ri­dor. She knocked twice and en­tered.

“Tom? You’ve got a vis­itor. This is Mr. Dumb­er­ton — sor­ry, Dun­der­bore. He’s come to tell you — well, I’ll let him do it.”

Har­ry and the two Dum­ble­dores en­tered the room, and Mrs. Cole closed the door on them. It was a small bare room with noth­ing in it ex­cept an old wardrobe and an iron bed­stead. A boy was sit­ting on top of the gray blan­kets, his legs stretched out in front of him, hold­ing a book.

There was no trace of the Gaunts in Tom Rid­dle’s face. Merope had got her dy­ing wish: He was his hand­some fa­ther in minia­ture, tall for eleven years old, dark­haired, and pale. His eyes nar­rowed slight­ly as he took in Dum­ble­dore’s ec­cen­tric ap­pear­an­ce. There was a mo­ment’s si­lence.

“How do you do, Tom?” said Dum­ble­dore, walk­ing for­ward and hold­ing out his hand.

The boy hes­itat­ed, then took it, and they shook hands. Dum­ble­dore drew up the hard wood­en chair be­side Rid­dle, so that the pair of them looked rather like a hos­pi­tal pa­tient and vis­itor.

“I am Pro­fes­sor Dum­ble­dore.”

“‘Pro­fes­sor’?” re­peat­ed Rid­dle. He looked wary. “Is that like ‘doc­tor’? What are you here for? Did she get you in to have a look at me?”

He was point­ing at the door through which Mrs. Cole had just left.

“No, no,” said Dum­ble­dore, smil­ing.

“I don’t be­lieve you,” said Rid­dle. “She wants me looked at, doesn’t she? Tell the truth!”

He spoke the last three words with a ring­ing force that was al­most shock­ing. It was a com­mand, and it sound­ed as though he had giv­en it many times be­fore. His eyes had widened and he was glar­ing at Dum­ble­dore, who made no re­sponse ex­cept to con­tin­ue smil­ing pleas­ant­ly. Af­ter a few sec­onds Rid­dle stopped glar­ing, though he looked, if any­thing, wari­er still.

“Who are you?”

“I have told you. My name is Pro­fes­sor Dum­ble­dore and I work at a school called Hog­warts. I have come to of­fer you a place at my school — your new school, if you would like to come.”

Rid­dle’s re­ac­tion to this was most sur­pris­ing. He leapt from the bed and backed away from Dum­ble­dore, look­ing fu­ri­ous.

“You can’t kid me! The asy­lum, that’s where you’re from, isn’t it? ‘Pro­fes­sor,’ yes, of course — well, I’m not go­ing, see? That old cat’s the one who should be in the asy­lum. I nev­er did any­thing to lit­tle Amy Ben­son or Den­nis Bish­op, and you can ask them, they’ll tell you!

“I am not from the asy­lum,” said Dum­ble­dore pa­tient­ly. “I am a teach­er and, if you will sit down calm­ly, I shall tell you about Hog­warts. Of course, if you would rather not come to the school, no­body will force you —”

“I’d like to see them try,” sneered Rid­dle.

“Hog­warts,” Dum­ble­dore went on, as though he had not heard Rid­dle’s last words, “is a school for peo­ple with spe­cial abil­ities —”

“I’m not mad!”

“I know that you are not mad. Hog­warts is not a school for mad peo­ple. It is a school of mag­ic.”

There was si­lence. Rid­dle had frozen, his face ex­pres­sion­less, but his eyes were flick­er­ing back and forth be­tween each of Dum­ble­dore’s, as though try­ing to catch one of them ly­ing.

“Mag­ic?” he re­peat­ed in a whis­per.

“That’s right,” said Dum­ble­dore.

“It’s. . . it’s mag­ic, what I can do?”

“What is it that you can do?”

“All sorts,” breathed Rid­dle. A flush of ex­cite­ment was ris­ing up his neck in­to his hol­low cheeks; he looked fevered. “I can make fil­in­gs move with­out touch­ing them. I can make an­imals do what I want them to do, with­out train­ing them. I can make bad things hap­pen to peo­ple who an­noy me. I can make them hurt if I want to.”

His legs were trem­bling. He stum­bled for­ward and sat down on the bed again, star­ing at his hands, his head bowed as though in prayer.

“I knew I was dif­fer­ent,” he whis­pered to his own quiv­er­ing fin­gers. “I knew I was spe­cial. Al­ways, I knew there was some­thing.”

“Well, you were quite right,” said Dum­ble­dore, who was no longer smil­ing, but watch­ing Rid­dle in­tent­ly. “You are a wiz­ard.”

Rid­dle lift­ed his head. His face was trans­fig­ured: There was a wild hap­pi­ness up­on it, yet for some rea­son it did not make him bet­ter look­ing; on the con­trary, his fine­ly carved fea­tures seemed some­how rougher, his ex­pres­sion al­most bes­tial.

“Are you a wiz­ard too?”

“Yes, I am.”

“Prove it,” said Rid­dle at once, in the same com­mand­ing tone he had used when he had said, “Tell the truth.”

Dum­ble­dore raised his eye­brows. “If, as I take it, you are ac­cept­ing your place at Hog­warts—”

“Of course I am!”

“Then you will ad­dress me as ‘Pro­fes­sor’ or ’sir.’”

Rid­dle’s ex­pres­sion hard­ened for the most fleet­ing mo­ment be­fore he said, in an un­rec­og­niz­ably po­lite voice, “I’m sor­ry, sir. I meant — please, Pro­fes­sor, could you show me — ?”

Har­ry was sure that Dum­ble­dore was go­ing to refuse, that he would tell Rid­dle there would be plen­ty of time for prac­ti­cal de­mon­stra­tions at Hog­warts, that they were cur­rent­ly in a build­ing full of Mug­gles and must there­fore be cau­tious. To his great sur­prise, how­ev­er, Dum­ble­dore drew his wand from an in­side pock­et of his suit jack­et, point­ed it at the shab­by wardrobe in the cor­ner, and gave the wand a ca­su­al flick.

The wardrobe burst in­to flames.

Rid­dle jumped to his feet; Har­ry could hard­ly blame him for howl­ing in shock and rage; all his world­ly pos­ses­sions must be in there. But even as Rid­dle round­ed on Dum­ble­dore, the flames van­ished, leav­ing the wardrobe com­plete­ly un­dam­aged.

Rid­dle stared from the wardrobe to Dum­ble­dore; then, his ex­pres­sion greedy, he point­ed at the wand. “Where can I get one of them?”

“All in good time,” said Dum­ble­dore. “I think there is some­thing try­ing to get out of your wardrobe.”

And sure enough, a faint rat­tling could be heard from in­side it. For the first time, Rid­dle looked fright­ened.

“Open the door,” said Dum­ble­dore.

Rid­dle hes­itat­ed, then crossed the room and threw open the wardrobe door. On the top­most shelf, above a rail of thread­bare clothes, a small card­board box was shak­ing and rat­tling as though there were sev­er­al fran­tic mice trapped in­side it.

“Take it out,” said Dum­ble­dore.

Rid­dle took down the quak­ing box. He looked un­nerved.

“Is there any­thing in that box that you ought not to have?” asked Dum­ble­dore.

Rid­dle threw Dum­ble­dore a long, clear, cal­cu­lat­ing look. “Yes, I sup­pose so, sir,” he said fi­nal­ly, in an ex­pres­sion­less voice.

“Open it,” said Dum­ble­dore.

Rid­dle took off the lid and tipped the con­tents on­to his bed with­out look­ing at them. Har­ry, who had ex­pect­ed some­thing much more ex­cit­ing, saw a mess of small, ev­ery­day ob­jects: a yoyo, a sil­ver thim­ble, and a tar­nished mouth or­gan among them. Once free of the box, they stopped quiv­er­ing and lay quite still up­on the thin blan­kets.

“You will re­turn them to their own­ers with your apo­lo­gies,” said Dum­ble­dore calm­ly, putting his wand back in­to his jack­et. “I shall know whether it has been done. And be warned: Thiev­ing is not tol­er­at­ed at Hog­warts.”

Rid­dle did not look re­mote­ly abashed; he was still star­ing cold­ly and ap­prais­ing­ly at Dum­ble­dore. At last he said in a col­or­less voice, “Yes, sir.”

“At Hog­warts,” Dum­ble­dore went on, “we teach you not on­ly to use mag­ic, but to con­trol it. You have — in­ad­ver­tent­ly, I am sure — been us­ing your pow­ers in a way that is nei­ther taught nor tol­er­at­ed at our school. You are not the first, nor will you be the last, to al­low your mag­ic to run away with you. But you should know that Hog­warts can ex­pel stu­dents, and the Min­istry of Mag­ic — yes, there is a Min­istry — will pun­ish law­break­ers still more se­vere­ly. All new wiz­ards must ac­cept that, in en­ter­ing our world, they abide by our laws.”

“Yes, sir,” said Rid­dle again.

It was im­pos­si­ble to tell what he was think­ing; his face re­mained quite blank as he put the lit­tle cache of stolen ob­jects back in­to the card­board box. When he had fin­ished, he turned to Dum­ble­dore and said bald­ly, “I haven’t got any mon­ey.”

“That is eas­ily reme­died,” said Dum­ble­dore, draw­ing a leather mon­ey­pouch from his pock­et. “There is a fund at Hog­warts for those who re­quire as­sis­tance to buy books and robes. You might have to buy some of your spell­books and so on sec­ond­hand, but —”

“Where do you buy spell­books?” in­ter­rupt­ed Rid­dle, who had tak­en the heavy mon­ey bag with­out thank­ing Dum­ble­dore, and was now ex­am­in­ing a fat gold Galleon,

“In Di­agon Al­ley,” said Dum­ble­dore. “I have your list of books and school equip­ment with me. I can help you find ev­ery­thing —”

“You’re com­ing with me?” asked Rid­dle, look­ing up.

“Cer­tain­ly, if you —”

“I don’t need you,” said Rid­dle. “I’m used to do­ing things for my­self, I go round Lon­don on my own all the time. How do you get to this Di­agon Al­ley — sir?” he added, catch­ing Dum­ble­dore’s eye.

Har­ry thought that Dum­ble­dore would in­sist up­on ac­com­pa­ny­ing Rid­dle, but once again he was sur­prised. Dum­ble­dore hand­ed Rid­dle the en­ve­lope con­tain­ing his list of equip­ment, and af­ter telling Rid­dle ex­act­ly how to get to the Leaky Caul­dron from the or­phan­age, he said, “You will be able to see it, al­though Mug­gles around you — non­mag­ical peo­ple, that is — will not. Ask for Tom the bar­man — easy enough to re­mem­ber, as he shares your name —”

Rid­dle gave an ir­ri­ta­ble twitch, as though try­ing to dis­place an irk­some fly.

“You dis­like the name ‘Tom’?”

“There are a lot of Toms,” mut­tered Rid­dle. Then, as though he could not sup­press the ques­tion, as though it burst from him in spite of him­self, he asked, “Was my fa­ther a wiz­ard? He was called Tom Rid­dle too, they’ve told me.”

“I’m afraid I don’t know,” said Dum­ble­dore, his voice gen­tle.

“My moth­er can’t have been mag­ic, or she wouldn’t have died,” said Rid­dle, more to him­self than Dum­ble­dore. “It must’ve been him. So — when I’ve got all my stuff— when do I come to this Hog­warts?”

“All the de­tails are on the sec­ond piece of parch­ment in your en­ve­lope,” said Dum­ble­dore. “You will leave from King’s Cross Sta­tion on the first of Septem­ber. There is a train tick­et in there too.”

Rid­dle nod­ded. Dum­ble­dore got to his feet and held out his hand again. Tak­ing it, Rid­dle said, “I can speak to snakes. I found out when we’ve been to the coun­try on trips — they find me, they whis­per to me. Is that nor­mal for a wiz­ard?”

Har­ry could tell that he had with­held men­tion of this strangest pow­er un­til that mo­ment, de­ter­mined to im­press.

“It is un­usu­al,” said Dum­ble­dore, af­ter a mo­ment’s hes­ita­tion, “but not un­heard of.”

His tone was ca­su­al but his eyes moved cu­ri­ous­ly over Rid­dle’s face. They stood for a mo­ment, man and boy, star­ing at each oth­er. Then the hand­shake was bro­ken; Dum­ble­dore was at the door.

“Good­bye, Tom. I shall see you at Hog­warts.”

“I think that will do,” said the white­haired Dum­ble­dore at Har­ry’s side, and sec­onds lat­er, they were soar­ing weight­less­ly through dark­ness once more, be­fore land­ing square­ly in the present­day of­fice.

“Sit down,” said Dum­ble­dore, land­ing be­side Har­ry.

Har­ry obeyed, his mind still full of what he had just seen.

“He be­lieved it much quick­er than I did — I mean, when you told him he was a wiz­ard,” said Har­ry. “I didn’t be­lieve Ha­grid at first, when he told me.”

“Yes, Rid­dle was per­fect­ly ready to be­lieve that he was — to use his word — ’spe­cial,’” said Dum­ble­dore.

“Did you know — then?” asked Har­ry.

“Did I know that I had just met the most dan­ger­ous Dark wiz­ard of all time?” said Dum­ble­dore. “No, I had no idea that he was to grow up to be what he is. How­ev­er, I was cer­tain­ly in­trigued by him. I re­turned to Hog­warts in­tend­ing to keep an eye up­on him, some­thing I should have done in any case, giv­en that he was alone and friend­less, but which, al­ready, I felt I ought to do for oth­ers’ sake as much as his.

“His pow­ers, as you heard, were sur­pris­ing­ly wellde­vel­oped for such a young wiz­ard and — most in­ter­est­ing­ly and omi­nous­ly of all — he had al­ready dis­cov­ered that he had some mea­sure of con­trol over them, and be­gun to use them con­scious­ly. And as you saw, they were not the ran­dom ex­per­iments typ­ical of young wiz­ards: He was al­ready us­ing mag­ic against oth­er peo­ple, to fright­en, to pun­ish, to con­trol. The lit­tle sto­ries of the stran­gled rab­bit and the young boy and girl he lured in­to a cave were most sug­ges­tive. . . . ‘I can make them hurt if I want to. . . .’”

“And he was a Parsel­mouth,” in­ter­ject­ed Har­ry.

“Yes, in­deed; a rare abil­ity, and one sup­pos­ed­ly con­nect­ed with the Dark Arts, al­though as we know, there are Parsel­mouths among the great and the good too. In fact, his abil­ity to speak to ser­pents did not make me near­ly as un­easy as his ob­vi­ous in­stincts for cru­el­ty, se­cre­cy, and dom­ina­tion.

“Time is mak­ing fools of us again,” said Dum­ble­dore, in­di­cat­ing the dark sky be­yond the win­dows. “But be­fore we part, I want to draw your at­ten­tion to cer­tain fea­tures of the scene we have just wit­nessed, for they have a great bear­ing on the mat­ters we shall be dis­cussing in fu­ture meet­in­gs.

“First­ly, I hope you no­ticed Rid­dle’s re­ac­tion when I men­tioned that an­oth­er shared his first name, ‘Tom’?”

Har­ry nod­ded.

“There he showed his con­tempt for any­thing that tied him to oth­er peo­ple, any­thing that made him or­di­nary. Even then, he wished to be dif­fer­ent, sep­arate, no­to­ri­ous. He shed his name, as you know, with­in a few short years of that con­ver­sa­tion and cre­at­ed the mask of ‘Lord Volde­mort’ be­hind which he has been hid­den for so long.

“I trust that you al­so no­ticed that Tom Rid­dle was al­ready high­ly self­suf­fi­cient, se­cre­tive, and, ap­par­ent­ly, friend­less? He did not want help or com­pan­ion­ship on his trip to Di­agon Al­ley. He pre­ferred to op­er­ate alone. The adult Volde­mort is the same. You will hear many of his Death Eaters claim­ing that they are in his con­fi­dence, that they alone are close to him, even un­der­stand him. They are de­lud­ed. Lord Volde­mort has nev­er had a friend, nor do I be­lieve that he has ev­er want­ed one.

“And last­ly — I hope you are not too sleepy to pay at­ten­tion to this, Har­ry — the young Tom Rid­dle liked to col­lect tro­phies. You saw the box of stolen ar­ti­cles he had hid­den in his room. These were tak­en from vic­tims of his bul­ly­ing be­hav­ior, sou­venirs, if you will, of par­tic­ular­ly un­pleas­ant bits of mag­ic. Bear in mind this mag­pielike ten­den­cy, for this, par­tic­ular­ly, will be im­por­tant lat­er.

“And now, it re­al­ly is time for bed.”

Har­ry got to his feet. As he walked across the room, his eyes fell I up­on the lit­tle ta­ble on which Mar­vo­lo Gaunt’s ring had rest­ed last I time, but the ring was no longer there.

“Yes, Har­ry?” said Dum­ble­dore, for Har­ry had come to a halt.

“The ring’s gone,” said Har­ry, look­ing around. “But I thought I you might have the mouth or­gan or some­thing.”

Dum­ble­dore beamed at him, peer­ing over the top of his halfw moon spec­ta­cles.

“Very as­tute, Har­ry, but the mouth or­gan was on­ly ev­er a mouth or­gan.”

And on that enig­mat­ic note he waved to Har­ry, who un­der­stood him­self to be dis­missed.
