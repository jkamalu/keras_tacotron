Chapter 5: An Excess Of Phlegm


Har­ry and Dum­ble­dore ap­proached the back door of the Bur­row, which was sur­round­ed by the fa­mil­iar lit­ter of old Welling­ton boots and rusty caul­drons; Har­ry could hear the soft cluck­ing of sleepy chick­ens com­ing from a dis­tant shed. Dum­ble­dore knocked three times and Har­ry saw sud­den move­ment be­hind the kitchen win­dow.

“Who’s there?” said a ner­vous voice he rec­og­nized as Mrs. Weasley’s. “De­clare your­self!”

“It is I, Dum­ble­dore, bring­ing Har­ry.”

The door opened at once. There stood Mrs. Weasley, short, plump, and wear­ing an old green dress­ing gown.

“Har­ry, dear! Gra­cious, Al­bus, you gave me a fright, you said not to ex­pect you be­fore morn­ing!”

“We were lucky,” said Dum­ble­dore, ush­er­ing Har­ry over the thresh­old. “Slughorn proved much more per­suad­able than I had ex­pect­ed. Har­ry’s do­ing, of course. Ah, hel­lo, Nympha­do­ra!”

Har­ry looked around and saw that Mrs. Weasley was not alone, de­spite the late­ness of the hour. A young witch with a pale, heartshaped face and mousy brown hair was sit­ting at the ta­ble clutch­ing a large mug be­tween her hands.

“Hel­lo, Pro­fes­sor,” she said. ” Wotch­er, Har­ry.”

“Hi, Tonks.”

Har­ry thought she looked drawn, even ill, and there was some­thing forced in her smile. Cer­tain­ly her ap­pear­an­ce was less col­or­ful than usu­al with­out her cus­tom­ary shade of bub­blegumpink hair.

“I’d bet­ter be off,” she said quick­ly, stand­ing up and pulling her cloak around her shoul­ders. “Thanks for the tea and sym­pa­thy, Mol­ly”

“Please don’t leave on my ac­count,” said Dum­ble­dore cour­te­ous­ly, “I can­not stay, I have ur­gent mat­ters to dis­cuss with Ru­fus Scrim­geour.”

“No, no, I need to get go­ing,” said Tonks, not meet­ing Dum­ble­dore’s eyes. “‘Night…”

“Dear, why not come to din­ner at the week­end, Re­mus and Mad­Eye are com­ing… ?”

“No, re­al­ly, Mol­ly… thanks any­way… Good night, ev­ery­one.

Tonks hur­ried past Dum­ble­dore and Har­ry in­to the yard; a few paces be­yond the doorstep, she turned on the spot and van­ished in­to thin air. Har­ry no­ticed that Mrs. Weasley looked trou­bled.

“Well, I shall see you at Hog­warts, Har­ry,” said Dum­ble­dore. “Take care of your­self. Mol­ly, your ser­vant.”

He made Mrs. Weasley a bow and fol­lowed Tonks, van­ish­ing at pre­cise­ly the same spot. Mrs. Weasley closed the door on the emp­ty yard and then steered Har­ry by the shoul­ders in­to the full glow of the lantern on the ta­ble to ex­am­ine his ap­pear­an­ce.

“You’re like Ron,” she sighed, look­ing him up and down. “Both of you look as though you’ve had Stretch­ing jinx­es put on you. I swear Ron’s grown four inch­es since I last bought him school robes. Are you hun­gry, Har­ry?”

“Yeah, I am,” said Har­ry, sud­den­ly re­al­iz­ing just how hun­gry he was,

“Sit down, dear, I’ll knock some­thing up.”

As Har­ry sat down, a fur­ry gin­ger cat with a squashed face lumped on­to his knees and set­tled there, purring.

“So Hermione’s here?” he asked hap­pi­ly as he tick­led Crook­shanks be­hind the ears.

“Oh yes, she ar­rived the day be­fore yes­ter­day,” said Mrs. Weasley, rap­ping a large iron pot with her wand. It bounced on­to the stove with a loud clang and be­gan to bub­ble at once. “Ev­ery­one’s in bed, of course, we didn’t ex­pect you for hours. Here you are…”

She tapped the pot again; it rose in­to the air, flew to­ward Har­ry, and tipped over; Mrs. Weasley slid a bowl near­ly be­neath it just in lime to catch the stream of thick, steam­ing onion soup.

“Bread, dear?”

“Thanks, Mrs. Weasley.”

She waved her wand over her shoul­der; a loaf of bread and a knife soared grace­ful­ly on­to the ta­ble; as the loaf sliced it­self and the soup pot dropped back on­to the stove, Mrs. Weasley sat down op­po­site him.

“So you per­suad­ed Ho­race Slughorn to take the job?”

Har­ry nod­ded, his mouth so full of hot soup that he could not speak.

“He taught Arthur and me,” said Mrs. Weasley. “He was at Hog­warts for ages, start­ed around the same time as Dum­ble­dore, I think. Did you like him?”

His mouth now full of bread, Har­ry shrugged and gave a non­com­mit­tal jerk of the head.

“I know what you mean,” said Mrs. Weasley, nod­ding wise­ly. “Of course he can be charm­ing when he wants to be, but Arthur’s nev­er liked him much. The Min­istry’s lit­tered with Slughorn’s old fa­vorites, he was al­ways good at giv­ing leg ups, but he nev­er had much time for Arthur… didn’t seem to think he was enough of a high­fli­er. Well, that just shows you, even Slughorn makes mis­takes. I don’t know whether Ron’s told you in any of his let­ters… it’s on­ly just hap­pened… but Arthur’s been pro­mot­ed!”

It could not have been clear­er that Mrs. Weasley had been burst­ing to say this.

Har­ry sw­al­lowed a large amount of very hot soup and thought he could feel his throat blis­ter­ing. “That’s great!” he gasped.

“You are sweet,” beamed Mrs. Weasley, pos­si­bly tak­ing his wa­ter­ing eyes for emo­tion at the news. “Yes, Ru­fus Scrim­geour has set up sev­er­al new of­fices in re­sponse to the present sit­ua­tion, and Arthur’s head­ing the Of­fice for the De­tec­tion and Con­fis­ca­tion of Coun­ter­feit De­fen­sive Spells and Pro­tec­tive Ob­jects. It’s a big job, he’s got ten peo­ple re­port­ing to him now!”

“What ex­act­ly?”

“Well, you see, in all the pan­ic about YouKnowWho, odd things have been crop­ping up for sale ev­ery­where, things that are sup­posed to guard against YouKnowWho and the Death Eaters. You can imag­ine the kind of thing… so­called pro­tec­tive po­tions that are re­al­ly gravy with a bit of bubo­tu­ber pus added, or in­struc­tions for de­fen­sive jinx­es that ac­tu­al­ly make your ears fall off… Well, in the main the per­pe­tra­tors are just peo­ple like Mundun­gus Hote­li­er, who’ve nev­er done an hon­est day’s work in their lives and are tak­ing ad­van­tage of how fright­ened ev­ery­body is, but ev­ery now and then some­thing re­al­ly nasty turns up. The oth­er day Arthur con­fis­cat­ed a box of cursed Sneako­scopes that were al­most cer­tain­ly plant­ed by a Death Eater. So you see, it’s a very im­por­tant job, and I tell him it’s just sil­ly to miss deal­ing with spark plugs and toast­ers and all the rest of that Mug­gle rub­bish.” Mrs. Weasley end­ed her speech with a stern look, as if it had been Har­ry sug­gest­ing that it was nat­ural to miss spark plugs.

“Is Mr. Weasley still at work?” Har­ry asked.

“Yes, he is. As a mat­ter of fact, he’s a tiny bit late… He said he’d be back around mid­night…”

She turned to look at a large clock that was perched awk­ward­ly on top of a pile of sheets in the wash­ing bas­ket at the end of the ta­ble. Har­ry rec­og­nized it at once: It had nine hands, each in­scribed with the name of a fam­ily mem­ber, and usu­al­ly hung on i he Weasleys’ sit­ting room wall, though its cur­rent po­si­tion sug­gest­ed that Mrs. Weasley had tak­en to car­ry­ing it around the house with her. Ev­ery sin­gle one of its nine hands was now point­ing at “mor­tal per­il.”

“It’s been like that for a while now,” said Mrs. Weasley, in an un­con­vinc­ing­ly ca­su­al voice, “ev­er since YouKnowWho came back in­to the open. I sup­pose ev­ery­body’s in mor­tal dan­ger now… I don’t think it can be just our fam­ily… but I don’t know any­one else who’s got a clock like this, so I can’t check. Oh!”

With a sud­den ex­cla­ma­tion she point­ed at the clock’s face. Mr. Weasley’s hand had switched to “trav­el­ing.”

“He’s com­ing!”

And sure enough, a mo­ment lat­er there was a knock on the back door. Mrs. Weasley jumped up and hur­ried to it; with one hand on the door­knob and her face pressed against the wood she called soft­ly, “Arthur, is that you?”

“Yes,” came Mr. Weasley’s weary voice. “But I would say that even if I were a Death Eater, dear. Ask the ques­tion!”

“Oh, hon­est­ly…”

“Mol­ly!”

“All right, all right… What is your dear­est am­bi­tion?”

“To find out how air­planes stay up.”

Mrs. Weasley nod­ded and turned the door­knob, but ap­par­ent­ly Mr. Weasley was hold­ing tight to it on the oth­er side, be­cause the door re­mained firm­ly shut.

“Mol­ly! I’ve got to ask you your ques­tion first!”

“Arthur, re­al­ly, this is just sil­ly…”

“What do you like me to call you when we’re alone to­geth­er?”

Even by the dim light of the lantern Har­ry could tell that Mrs. Weasley had turned bright red; he him­self felt sud­den­ly warm around the ears and neck, and hasti­ly gulped soup, clat­ter­ing his spoon as loud­ly as he could against the bowl.

“Mol­ly­wob­bles,” whis­pered a mor­ti­fied Mrs. Weasley in­to the crack at the edge of the door.

“Cor­rect,” said Mr. Weasley. “Now you can let me in.”

Mrs. Weasley opened the door to re­veal her hus­band, a thin, bald­ing, red­haired wiz­ard wear­ing horn­rimmed spec­ta­cles and a long and dusty trav­el­ing cloak.

“I still don’t see why we have to go through that ev­ery time you come home,” said Mrs. Weasley, still pink in the face as she helped her hus­band out of his cloak. “I mean, a Death Eater might have forced the an­swer out of you be­fore im­per­son­at­ing you!”

“I know, dear, but it’s Min­istry pro­ce­dure, and I have to set an ex­am­ple. Some­thing smells good… onion soup?”

Mr. Weasley turned hope­ful­ly in the di­rec­tion of the ta­ble.

“Har­ry! We didn’t ex­pect you un­til morn­ing!”

They shook hands, and Mr. Weasley dropped in­to the chair be­side Har­ry as Mrs. Weasley set a bowl of soup in front of him too.

“Thanks, Mol­ly. It’s been a tough night. Some id­iot’s start­ed sell­ing Meta­mor­phMedals. Just sling them around your neck and you’ll be able to change your ap­pear­an­ce at will. A hun­dred thou­sand dis­guis­es, all for ten Galleons!”

“And what re­al­ly hap­pens when you put them on?”

“Most­ly you just turn a fair­ly un­pleas­ant or­ange col­or, but a cou­ple of peo­ple have al­so sprout­ed ten­ta­cle like warts all over their bod­ies. As if St. Mun­go’s didn’t have enough to do al­ready!”

“It sounds like the sort of thing Fred and George would find fun­ny,” said Mrs. Weasley hes­itant­ly. “Are you sure… ?”

“Of course I am!” said Mr. Weasley. “The boys wouldn’t do any­thing like that now, not when peo­ple are des­per­ate for pro­tec­tion!”

“So is that why you’re late, Meta­mor­phMedals?”

“No, we got wind of a nasty back­fir­ing jinx down in Ele­phant and Cas­tle, but luck­ily the Mag­ical Law En­force­ment Squad had sort­ed it out by the time we got there…”

Har­ry sti­fled a yawn be­hind his hand.

“Bed,” said an un­de­ceived Mrs. Weasley at once. “I’ve got Fred and George’s room all ready for you, you’ll have it to your­self.”

“Why, where are they?”

“Oh, they’re in Di­agon Al­ley, sleep­ing in the lit­tle flat over their joke shop as they’re so busy,” said Mrs. Weasley. “I must say, I didn’t ap­prove at first, but they do seem to have a bit of a flair for busi­ness! Come on, dear, your trunks al­ready up there.”

“‘Night, Mr. Weasley,” said Har­ry, push­ing back his chair. Crook­shanks leapt light­ly from his lap and slunk out of the room.

“G’night, Har­ry,” said Mr. Weasley.

Har­ry saw Mrs. Weasley glance at the clock in the wash­ing bas­ket as they left the kitchen. All the hands were once again at “mor­tal per­il.”

Fred and George’s bed­room was on the sec­ond floor. Mrs. Weasley point­ed her wand at a lamp on the bed­side ta­ble and it ig­nit­ed at once, bathing the room in a pleas­ant gold­en glow. Though a large vase of flow­ers had been placed on a desk in front of the small win­dow, their per­fume could not dis­guise the lin­ger­ing smell of what Har­ry thought was gun­pow­der. A con­sid­er­able amount of floor space was de­vot­ed to a vast num­ber of un­marked, sealed card­board box­es, amongst which stood Har­ry’s school trunk. The room looked as though it was be­ing used as a tem­po­rary ware­house.

Hed­wig hoot­ed hap­pi­ly at Har­ry from her perch on top of a large wardrobe, then took off through the win­dow; Har­ry knew she had been wait­ing to see him be­fore go­ing hunt­ing. Har­ry bade Mrs. Weasley good night, put on pa­ja­mas, and got in­to one of the beds. There was some­thing hard in­side the pil­low­case. He groped in­side it and pulled out a sticky pur­ple­an­dor­ange sweet, which he rec­og­nized as a Puk­ing Pastille. Smil­ing to him­self, he rolled over and was in­stant­ly asleep.

Sec­onds lat­er, or so it seemed to Har­ry, he was awak­ened by what sound­ed like can­non fire as the door burst open. Sit­ting bolt up­right, he heard the rasp of the cur­tains be­ing pulled back: The daz­zling sun­light seemed to poke him hard in both eyes. Shield­ing them with one hand, he groped hope­less­ly for his glass­es with the oth­er.

“Wuz­zgoinon?”

“We didn’t know you were here al­ready!” said a loud and ex­cit­ed voice, and he re­ceived a sharp blow to the top of the head.

“Ron, don’t hit him!” said a girl’s voice re­proach­ful­ly.

Har­ry’s hand found his glass­es and he shoved them on, though I he light was so bright he could hard­ly see any­way. A long, loom­ing shad­ow quiv­ered in front of him for a mo­ment; he blinked and Ron Weasley came in­to fo­cus, grin­ning down at him.

“All right?”

“Nev­er been bet­ter,” said Har­ry, rub­bing the top of his head and slump­ing back on­to his pil­lows. “You?”

“Not bad,” said Ron, pulling over a card­board box and sit­ting on it. “When did you get here? Mum’s on­ly just told us!”

“About one o’clock this morn­ing.”

“Were the Mug­gles all right? Did they treat you okay?”

“Same as usu­al,” said Har­ry, as Hermione perched her­self on the edge of his bed, “they didn’t talk to me much, but I like it bet­ter that way. How’re you, Hermione?”

“Oh, I’m fine,” said Hermione, who was scru­ti­niz­ing Har­ry as though he was sick­en­ing for some­thing. He thought he knew what was be­hind this, and as he had no wish to dis­cuss Sir­ius’s death or any oth­er mis­er­able sub­ject at the mo­ment, he said, “What’s the time? Have I missed break­fast?”

“Don’t wor­ry about that, Mum’s bring­ing you up a tray; she reck­ons you look un­der­fed,” said Ron, rolling his eyes. “So, what’s been go­ing on?”

“Noth­ing much, I’ve just been stuck at my aunt and un­cle’s, haven’t I?”

“Come off it!” said Ron. “You’ve been off with Dum­ble­dore!”

“It wasn’t that ex­cit­ing. He just want­ed me to help him per­suade this old teach­er to come out of re­tire­ment. His name’s Ho­race Slughorn.”

“Oh,” said Ron, look­ing dis­ap­point­ed. “We thought…”

Hermione flashed a warn­ing look at Ron, and Ron changed tack at top speed.

“…we thought it’d be some­thing like that.”

“You did?” said Har­ry, amused.

“Yeah… yeah, now Um­bridge has left, ob­vi­ous­ly we need a new De­fense Against the Dark Arts teach­er, don’t we? So, er, what’s he like?”

“He looks a bit like a wal­rus, and he used to be Head of Slytherin,” said Har­ry. “Some­thing wrong, Hermione?”

She was watch­ing him as though ex­pect­ing strange symp­toms to man­ifest them­selves at any mo­ment. She re­ar­ranged her fea­tures hasti­ly in an un­con­vinc­ing smile.

“No, of course not! So, um, did Slughorn seem like he’ll be a good teach­er?”

“Dun­no,” said Har­ry. “He can’t be worse than Um­bridge, can he?”

“I know some­one who’s worse than Um­bridge,” said a voice from the door­way. Ron’s younger sis­ter slouched in­to the room, look­ing ir­ri­ta­ble. “Hi, Har­ry.”

“What’s up with you?” Ron asked.

“It’s her,” said Gin­ny, plonk­ing her­self down on Har­ry’s bed. “She’s driv­ing me mad.”

“What’s she done now?” asked Hermione sym­pa­thet­ical­ly.

“It’s the way she talks to me… you’d think I was about three!”

“I know,” said Hermione, drop­ping her voice. “She’s so full of her­self.”

Har­ry was as­ton­ished to hear Hermione talk­ing about Mrs. Weasley like this and could not blame Ron for say­ing an­gri­ly, “Can’t you two lay off her for five sec­onds?”

“Oh, that’s right, de­fend her,” snapped Gin­ny. “We all know you can’t get enough of her.”

This seemed an odd com­ment to make about Ron’s moth­er. Start­ing to feel that he was miss­ing some­thing, Har­ry said, “Who are you… ?”

But his ques­tion was an­swered be­fore he could fin­ish it. The bed­room door flew open again, and Har­ry in­stinc­tive­ly yanked the bed­cov­ers up to his chin so hard that Hermione and Gin­ny slid off the bed on­to the floor.

A young wom­an was stand­ing in the door­way, a wom­an of such breath­tak­ing beau­ty that the room seemed to have be­come strange­ly air­less. She was tall and wil­lowy with long blonde hair and ap­peared to em­anate a faint, sil­very glow. To com­plete this vi­sion of per­fec­tion, she was car­ry­ing a heav­ily laden break­fast tray.

“‘Ar­ry,” she said in a throaty voice. “Eet ‘as been too long!”

As she swept over the thresh­old to­ward him, Mrs. Weasley was re­vealed, bob­bing along in her wake, look­ing rather cross.

“There was no need to bring up the tray, I was just about to do it my­self!”

“Eet was no trou­ble,” said Fleur Dela­cour, set­ting the tray across Har­ry’s knees and then swoop­ing to kiss him on each cheek: He felt the places where her mouth had touched him burn. “I ‘ave been long­ing to see ‘im. You re­mem­ber my seester, Gabrielle? She nev­er stops talk­ing about ‘Ar­ry Pot­ter. She will be de­light­ed to see you again.”

“Oh… is she here too?” Har­ry croaked.

“No, no, sil­ly boy,” said Fleur with a tin­kling laugh, “I mean next sum­mer, when we… but do you not know?”

Her great blue eyes widened and she looked re­proach­ful­ly at Mrs. Weasley, who said, “We hadn’t got around to telling him yet.”

Fleur turned back to Har­ry, swing­ing her sil­very sheet of hair so that it whipped Mrs. Weasley across the face.

“Bill and I are go­ing to be mar­ried!”

“Oh,” said Har­ry blankly. He could not help not­ic­ing how Mrs. Weasley, Hermione, and Gin­ny were all de­ter­mined­ly avoid­ing one an­oth­er’s gaze. “Wow. Er… con­grat­ula­tions!”

She swooped down up­on him and kissed him again.

“Bill is very busy at ze mo­ment, work­ing very ‘ard, and I on­ly work part­time at Gringotts for my Eenglish, so he brought me ‘ere for a few days to get to know ‘is fam­ily prop­er­ly. I was so pleased to ‘ear you would be com­ing… zere isn’t much to do ‘ere, un­less you like cook­ing and chick­ens! Well… en­joy your break­fast, ‘Ar­ry!”

With these words she turned grace­ful­ly and seemed to float out of the room, clos­ing the door qui­et­ly be­hind her.

Mrs. Weasley made a noise that sound­ed like, “tchah!”

“Mum hates her,” said Gin­ny qui­et­ly.

“I do not hate her!” said Mrs. Weasley in a cross whis­per. “I just think they’ve hur­ried in­to this en­gage­ment, that’s all!”

“They’ve known each oth­er a year,” said Ron, who looked odd­ly grog­gy and was star­ing at the closed door.

“Well, that’s not very long! I know why it’s hap­pened, of course. Its all this un­cer­tain­ty with YouKnowWho com­ing back, peo­ple think they might be dead to­mor­row, so they’re rush­ing all sorts of de­ci­sions they’d nor­mal­ly take time over. It was the same last time he was pow­er­ful, peo­ple el­op­ing left, right, and cen­ter…”

“In­clud­ing you and Dad,” said Gin­ny sly­ly.

“Yes, well, your fa­ther and I were made for each oth­er, what was the point in wait­ing?” said Mrs. Weasley. “Where­as Bill and Fleur… well… what have they re­al­ly got in com­mon? He’s a hard­work­ing, down­toearth sort of per­son, where­as she’s…”

“A cow,” said Gin­ny, nod­ding. “But Bill’s not that down­toearth. He’s a Curse­Break­er, isn’t he, he likes a bit of ad­ven­ture, a bit of glam­our… I ex­pect that’s why he’s gone for Phlegm.”

“Stop call­ing her that, Gin­ny,” said Mrs. Weasley sharply, as Har­ry and Hermione laughed. “Well, I’d bet­ter get on… Eat your eggs while they’re warm, Har­ry.”

Look­ing care­worn, she left the room. Ron still seemed slight­ly punch­drunk; he was shak­ing his head ex­per­imen­tal­ly like a dog try­ing to rid its ears of wa­ter.

“Don’t you get used to her if she’s stay­ing in the same house?” Har­ry asked.

“Well, you do,” said Ron, “but if she jumps out at you un­ex­pect­ed­ly, like then…”

“It’s pa­thet­ic,” said Hermione fu­ri­ous­ly, strid­ing away from Ron as far as she could go and turn­ing to face him with her arms fold­ed once she had reached the wall.

“You don’t re­al­ly want her around for­ev­er?” Gin­ny asked Ron in­cred­ulous­ly. When he mere­ly shrugged, she said, “Well, Mum’s go­ing to put a stop to it if she can, I bet you any­thing.”

“How’s she go­ing to man­age that?” asked Har­ry.

“She keeps try­ing to get Tonks round for din­ner. I think she’s hop­ing Bill will fall for Tonks in­stead. I hope he does, I’d much rather have her in the fam­ily.”

“Yeah, that’ll work,” said Ron sar­cas­ti­cal­ly. “Lis­ten, no bloke in his right mind’s go­ing to fan­cy Tonks when Fleur’s around. I mean, Tonks is okay­look­ing when she isn’t do­ing stupid things to her hair and her nose, but…”

“She’s a damn sight nicer than Phlegm? said Gin­ny.

“And she’s more in­tel­li­gent, she’s an Au­ror!” said Hermione from the cor­ner.

“Fleur’s not stupid, she was good enough to en­ter the Tri­wiz­ard Tour­na­ment,” said Har­ry.

“Not you as well!” said Hermione bit­ter­ly.

“I sup­pose you like the way Phlegm says ‘ ‘Any,’ do you?” asked Gin­ny scorn­ful­ly.

“No,” said Har­ry, wish­ing he hadn’t spo­ken, “I was just say­ing, Phlegm… I mean, Fleur…”

“I’d much rather have Tonks in the fam­ily,” said Gin­ny. “At least she’s a laugh.”

“She hasn’t been much of a laugh late­ly,” said Ron. “Ev­ery time I’ve seen her she’s looked more like Moan­ing Myr­tle.”

“That’s not fair,” snapped Hermione. “She still hasn’t got over what hap­pened… you know… I mean, he was her cousin!”

Har­ry’s heart sank. They had ar­rived at Sir­ius. He picked up a fork and be­gan shov­el­ing scram­bled eggs in­to his mouth, hop­ing to de­flect any in­vi­ta­tion to join in this part of the con­ver­sa­tion.

“Tonks and Sir­ius bare­ly knew each oth­er!” said Ron. “Sir­ius was in Azk­aban half her life and be­fore that their fam­ilies nev­er met…”

“That’s not the point,” said Hermione. “She thinks it was her lim­it he died!”

“How does she work that one out?” asked Har­ry, in spite of him­self.

“Well, she was fight­ing Bel­la­trix Lestrange, wasn’t she? I think she feels that if on­ly she had fin­ished her off, Bel­la­trix couldn’t have killed Sir­ius.”

“That’s stupid,” said Ron.

“It’s sur­vivor’s guilt,” said Hermione. “I know Lupin’s tried to talk her round, but she’s still re­al­ly down. She’s ac­tu­al­ly hav­ing trou­ble with her Meta­mor­phos­ing!”

“With her…?”

“She can’t change her ap­pear­an­ce like she used to,” ex­plained Hermione. “I think her pow­ers must have been af­fect­ed by shock, or some­thing.”

“I didn’t know that could hap­pen,” said Har­ry.

“Nor did I,” said Hermione, “but I sup­pose if you’re re­al­ly de­pressed…”

The door opened again and Mrs. Weasley popped her head in. “Gin­ny,” she whis­pered, “come down­stairs and help me with the lunch.”

“I’m talk­ing to this lot!” said Gin­ny, out­raged.

“Now!” said Mrs. Weasley, and with­drew.

“She on­ly wants me there so she doesn’t have to be alone with Phlegm!” said Gin­ny cross­ly. She swung her long red hair around in a very good im­ita­tion of Fleur and pranced across the room with her arms held aloft like a bal­le­ri­na.

“You lot had bet­ter come down quick­ly too,” she said as she left.

Har­ry took ad­van­tage of the tem­po­rary si­lence to eat more break­fast. Hermione was peer­ing in­to Fred and George’s box­es, though ev­ery now and then she cast side­ways looks at Har­ry. Ron, who was now help­ing him­self to Har­ry…s toast, was still gaz­ing dream­ily at the door.

“What’s this?” Hermione asked even­tu­al­ly, hold­ing up what looked like a small tele­scope.

“Dun­no,” said Ron, “but if Fred and George left it here, it’s prob­ably not ready for the joke shop yet, so be care­ful”

“Your mum said the shop’s go­ing well,” said Har­ry. “Said Fred and George have got a re­al flair for busi­ness.”

“That’s an un­der­state­ment,” said Ron. “They’re rak­ing in the Galleons! I can’t wait to see the place, we haven’t been to Di­agon Al­ley yet, be­cause Mum says Dad’s got to be there for ex­tra se­cu­ri­ty and he’s been re­al­ly busy at work, but it sounds ex­cel­lent.”

“And what about Per­cy?” asked Har­ry; the third­el­dest Weasley broth­er had fall­en out with the rest of the fam­ily. “Is he talk­ing to your mum and dad again?”

“Nope,” said Ron.

“But he knows your dad was right all along now about Volde­mort be­ing back…”

“Dum­ble­dore says peo­ple find it far eas­ier to for­give oth­ers for be­ing wrong than be­ing right,” said Hermione. “I heard him telling your mum, Ron.”

“Sounds like the sort of men­tal thing Dum­ble­dore would say,” said Ron.

“He’s go­ing to be giv­ing me pri­vate lessons this year,” said Har­ry con­ver­sa­tion­al­ly.

Ron choked on his bit of toast, and Hermione gasped.

“You kept that qui­et!” said Ron.

“I on­ly just re­mem­bered,” said Har­ry hon­est­ly. “He told me last night in your broom shed.”

“Blimey… pri­vate lessons with Dum­ble­dore!” said Ron, look­ing im­pressed. “I won­der why he’s… ?”

His voice tailed away. Har­ry saw him and Hermione ex­change looks. Har­ry laid down his knife and fork, his heart beat­ing rather fast con­sid­er­ing that all he was do­ing was sit­ting in bed. Dum­ble­dore had said to do it… Why not now? He fixed his eyes on his fork, which was gleam­ing in the sun­light stream­ing in­to his lap, and said, “I don’t know ex­act­ly why he’s go­ing to be giv­ing me lessons, but I think it must be be­cause of the prophe­cy.”

Nei­ther Ron nor Hermione spoke. Har­ry had the im­pres­sion that both had frozen. He con­tin­ued, still speak­ing to his fork, “You know, the one they were try­ing to steal at the Min­istry.”

“No­body knows what it said, though,” said Hermione quick­ly. “It got smashed.”

“Al­though the Prophet says…” be­gan Ron, but Hermione said, “Shh!”

“The Prophet’s got it right,” said Har­ry, look­ing up at them both with a great ef­fort: Hermione seemed fright­ened and Ron amazed. “That glass ball that smashed wasn’t the on­ly record of the prophe­cy. I heard the whole thing in Dum­ble­dore’s of­fice, he was the one the prophe­cy was made to, so he could tell me. From what it said,” Har­ry took a deep breath, “it looks like I’m the one who’s got to fin­ish off Volde­mort… At least, it said nei­ther of us could live while the oth­er sur­vives.”

The three of them gazed at one an­oth­er in si­lence for a mo­ment. Then there was a loud bang and Hermione van­ished be­hind a puff of black smoke.

“Hermione!” shout­ed Har­ry and Ron; the break­fast tray slid to the floor with a crash.

Hermione emerged, cough­ing, out of the smoke, clutch­ing the tele­scope and sport­ing a bril­liant­ly pur­ple black eye.

“I squeezed it and it… it punched me!” she gasped.

And sure enough, they now saw a tiny fist on a long spring pro­trud­ing from the end of the tele­scope.

“Don’t wor­ry,” said Ron, who was plain­ly try­ing not to laugh, “Mum’ll fix that, she’s good at heal­ing mi­nor in­ju­ries…”

“Oh well, nev­er mind that now!” said Hermione hasti­ly. “Har­ry, oh, Har­ry…”

She sat down on the edge of his bed again.

“We won­dered, af­ter we got back from the Min­istry… Ob­vi­ous­ly, we didn’t want to say any­thing to you, but from what Lu­cius Mal­foy said about the prophe­cy, how it was about you and Volde­mort, well, we thought it might be some­thing like this… Oh, Har­ry…” She stared at him, then whis­pered, “Are you scared?”

“Not as much as I was,” said Har­ry. “When I first heard it, I was… but now, it seems as though I al­ways knew I’d have to face him in the end…”

“When we heard Dum­ble­dore was col­lect­ing you in per­son, we thought he might be telling you some­thing or show­ing you some­thing to do with the prophe­cy,” said Ron ea­ger­ly. “And we were kind of right, weren’t we? He wouldn’t be giv­ing you lessons if he thought you were a goner, wouldn’t waste his time… he must think you’ve got a chance!”

“That’s true,” said Hermione. “I won­der what he’ll teach you, Har­ry? Re­al­ly ad­vanced de­fen­sive mag­ic, prob­ably… pow­er­ful coun­ter­curs­es… an­ti­jinx­es…”

Har­ry did not re­al­ly lis­ten. A warmth was spread­ing through him that had noth­ing to do with the sun­light; a tight ob­struc­tion in his chest seemed to be dis­solv­ing. He knew that Ron and Hermione were more shocked than they were let­ting on, but the mere fact that they were still there on ei­ther side of him, speak­ing brac­ing words of com­fort, not shrink­ing from him as though he were con­tam­inat­ed or dan­ger­ous, was worth more than he could ev­er tell them.

“…and eva­sive en­chant­ments gen­er­al­ly,” con­clud­ed Hermione. “Well, at least you know one les­son you’ll be hav­ing this year, that’s one more than Ron and me. I won­der when our OWL re­sults will come?”

“Cant be long now, it’s been a month,” said Ron.

“Hang on,” said Har­ry, as an­oth­er part of last night’s con­ver­sa­tion came back to him. “I think Dum­ble­dore said our OWL re­sults would be ar­riv­ing to­day!”

“To­day?” shrieked Hermione. “To­day? But why didn’t you… oh my God… you should have said…”

She leapt to her feet.

“I’m go­ing to see whether any owls have come…”

But when Har­ry ar­rived down­stairs ten min­utes lat­er, ful­ly dressed and car­ry­ing his emp­ty break­fast tray, it was to find Hermione sit­ting at the kitchen ta­ble in great ag­ita­tion, while Mrs. Weasley tried to lessen her re­sem­blance to half a pan­da.

“It just won’t budge,” Mrs. Weasley was say­ing anx­ious­ly, stand­ing over Hermione with her wand in her hand and a copy of The Heal­er’s Help­mate open at “Bruis­es, Cuts, and Abra­sions.” “This has al­ways worked be­fore, I just can’t un­der­stand it.”

“It’ll be Fred and George’s idea of a fun­ny joke, mak­ing sure it can’t come off,” said Gin­ny.

“But it’s got to come off!” squeaked Hermione. “I can’t go around look­ing like this for­ev­er!”

“You won’t, dear, we’ll find an an­ti­dote, don’t wor­ry,” said Mrs. Weasley sooth­ing­ly.

“Bill told me W Fred and George are very amus­ing!” said Fleur, smil­ing serene­ly.

“Yes, I can hard­ly breathe for laugh­ing,” snapped Hermione.

She jumped up and start­ed walk­ing round and round the kitchen, twist­ing her fin­gers to­geth­er.

“Mrs. Weasley, you’re quite, quite sure no owls have ar­rived this morn­ing?”

“Yes, dear, I’d have no­ticed,” said Mrs. Weasley pa­tient­ly. “But it’s bare­ly nine, there’s still plen­ty of time…”

“I know I messed up An­cient Runes,” mut­tered Hermione fever­ish­ly, “I def­inite­ly made at least one se­ri­ous mis­trans­la­tion. And the De­fense Against the Dark Arts prac­ti­cal was no good at all. I thought Trans­fig­ura­tion went all right at the time, but look­ing back…”

“Hermione, will you shut up, you’re not the on­ly one who’s ner­vous!” barked Ron. “And when you’ve got your eleven ‘Out­stand­ing OWLs…’”

“Don’t, don’t, don’t!” said Hermione, flap­ping her hands hys­ter­ical­ly. “I know I’ve failed ev­ery­thing!”

“What hap­pens if we fail?” Har­ry asked the room at large, but it was again Hermione who an­swered.

“We dis­cuss our op­tions with our Head of House, I asked Pro­fes­sor McG­ona­gall at the end of last term.”

Har­ry’s stom­ach squirmed. He wished he had eat­en less break­fast.

“At Beaux­ba­tons,” said Fleur com­pla­cent­ly, “we ‘ad a dif­fer­ent way of do­ing things. I think eet was bet­ter. We sat our ex­am­ina­tions af­ter six years of study, not five, and then…”

Fleur’s words were drowned in a scream. Hermione was point­ing through the kitchen win­dow. Three black specks were clear­ly vis­ible in the sky, grow­ing larg­er all the time.

“They’re def­inite­ly owls,” said Ron hoarse­ly, jump­ing up to join Hermione at the win­dow.

“And there are three of them,” said Har­ry, has­ten­ing to her oth­er side.

“One for each of us,” said Hermione in a ter­ri­fied whis­per. “Oh no… oh no… oh no…”

She gripped both Har­ry and Ron tight­ly around the el­bows.

The owls were fly­ing di­rect­ly at the Bur­row, three hand­some tawnies, each of which, it be­came clear as they flew low­er over the path lead­ing up to the house, was car­ry­ing a large square en­ve­lope.

“Oh no!” squealed Hermione.

Mrs. Weasley squeezed past them and opened the kitchen win­dow. One, two, three, the owls soared through it and land­ed on the ta­ble in a neat line. All three of them lift­ed their right legs.

Har­ry moved for­ward. The let­ter ad­dressed to him was tied to the leg of the owl in the mid­dle. He un­tied it with fum­bling fin­gers. To his left, Ron was try­ing to de­tach his own re­sults; to his right, Hermione’s hands were shak­ing so much she was mak­ing her whole owl trem­ble.

No­body in the kitchen spoke. At last, Har­ry man­aged to de­tach the en­ve­lope. He slit it open quick­ly and un­fold­ed the parch­ment in­side.

Charms E

Div­ina­tion P

Her­bol­ogy E

His­to­ry of Mag­ic D

Po­tions E

Trans­fig­ura­tion E

Har­ry read the parch­ment through sev­er­al times, his breath­ing be­com­ing eas­ier with each read­ing. It was all right: He had al­ways known that he would fail Div­ina­tion, and he had had no chance of pass­ing His­to­ry of Mag­ic, giv­en that he had col­lapsed halfway through the ex­am­ina­tion, but he had passed ev­ery­thing else! He ran his fin­ger down the grades… he had passed well in Trans­fig­ura­tion and Her­bol­ogy, he had even ex­ceed­ed ex­pec­ta­tions at Po­tions! And best of all, he had achieved “Out­stand­ing” at De­fense Against the Dark Arts!

He looked around. Hermione had her back to him and her head bent, but Ron was look­ing de­light­ed.

“On­ly failed Div­ina­tion and His­to­ry of Mag­ic, and who cares about them?” he said hap­pi­ly to Har­ry. “Here… swap…”

Har­ry glanced down Ron’s grades: There were no “Out­stand­in­gs” there…

“Knew you’d be top at De­fense Against the Dark Arts,” said Ron, punch­ing Har­ry on the shoul­der. “We’ve done all right, haven’t we?”

“Well done!” said Mrs. Weasley proud­ly, ruf­fling Ron’s hair. “Sev­en OWLs, that’s more than Fred and George got to­geth­er!”

“Hermione?” said Gin­ny ten­ta­tive­ly, for Hermione still hadn’t turned around. “How did you do?”

“I–not bad,” said Hermione in a small voice.

“Oh, come off it,” said Ron, strid­ing over to her and whip­ping her re­sults out of her hand. “Yep… ten ‘Out­stand­in­gs’ and one ‘Ex­ceeds Ex­pec­ta­tions’ at De­fense Against the Dark Arts.” He looked down at her, hal­fa­mused, halfex­as­per­at­ed. “You’re ac­tu­al­ly dis­ap­point­ed, aren’t you?”

Hermione shook her head, but Har­ry laughed.

“Well, we’re N.E.W.T. stu­dents now!” grinned Ron. “Mum, are there any more sausages?”

Har­ry looked back down at his re­sults. They were as good as he could have hoped for. He felt just one tiny twinge of re­gret… This was the end of his am­bi­tion to be­come an Au­ror. He had not se­cured the re­quired Po­tions grade. He had known all along that he wouldn’t, but he still felt a sink­ing in his stom­ach as he looked again at that small black E.

It was odd, re­al­ly, see­ing that it had been a Death Eater in dis­guise who had first told Har­ry he would make a good Au­ror, but some­how the idea had tak­en hold of him, and he couldn’t re­al­ly think of any­thing else he would like to be. More­over, it had seemed the right des­tiny for him since he had heard the prophe­cy a few weeks ago… Nei­ther can live while the oth­er sur­vives…Wouldn’t he be liv­ing up to the prophe­cy, and giv­ing him­self the best chance of sur­vi­val, if he joined those high­ly trained wiz­ards whose job it was to find and kill Volde­mort?
