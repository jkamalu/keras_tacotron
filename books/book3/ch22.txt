CHAPTER TWENTY-TWO


Owl Post Again



‘Har­ry!’

Hermione was tug­ging at his sleeve, star­ing at her watch. ‘We’ve got ex­act­ly ten min­utes to get back down to the hos­pi­tal wing with­out any­body see­ing us – be­fore Dum­ble­dore locks the door –’

‘OK,’ said Har­ry, wrench­ing his gaze from the sky, ‘let’s go …’

They slipped through the door­way be­hind them and down a tight­ly spi­ralling stone stair­case. As they reached the bot­tom of it, they heard voic­es. They flat­tened them­selves against the wall and lis­tened. It sound­ed like Fudge and Snape. They were walk­ing quick­ly along the cor­ri­dor at the foot of the stair­case.

‘… on­ly hope Dum­ble­dore’s not go­ing to make dif­fi­cul­ties,’ Snape was say­ing. ‘The Kiss will be per­formed im­me­di­ate­ly?’

‘As soon as Mac­nair re­turns with the De­men­tors. This whole Black af­fair has been high­ly em­bar­rass­ing. I can’t tell you how much I’m look­ing for­ward to in­form­ing the Dai­ly Prophet that we’ve got him at last … I dare­say they’ll want to in­ter­view you, Snape … and once young Har­ry’s back in his right mind, I ex­pect he’ll want to tell the Prophet ex­act­ly how you saved him …’

Har­ry clenched his teeth. He caught a glimpse of Snape’s smirk as he and Fudge passed Har­ry and Hermione’s hid­ing place. Their foot­steps died away. Har­ry and Hermione wait­ed a few mo­ments to make sure they’d re­al­ly gone, then start­ed to run in the op­po­site di­rec­tion. Down one stair­case, then an­oth­er, along a new cor­ri­dor – then they heard a cack­ling ahead.

‘Peeves!’ Har­ry mut­tered, grab­bing Hermione’s wrist. ‘In here!’

They tore in­to a de­sert­ed class­room to their left just in time. Peeves seemed to be bounc­ing along the cor­ri­dor in tear­ing spir­its, laugh­ing his head off.

‘Oh, he’s hor­ri­ble,’ whis­pered Hermione, her ear to the door. ‘I bet he’s all ex­cit­ed be­cause the De­men­tors are go­ing to fin­ish Sir­ius …’ She checked her watch. ‘Three min­utes, Har­ry!’

They wait­ed un­til Peeves’s gloat­ing voice had fad­ed in­to the dis­tance, then slid back out of the room and broke in­to a run again.

‘Hermione – what’ll hap­pen – if we don’t get back in­side – be­fore Dum­ble­dore locks the door?’ Har­ry pant­ed.

‘I don’t want to think about it!’ Hermione moaned, check­ing her watch again. ‘One minute!’

They had reached the end of the cor­ri­dor with the hos­pi­tal-​wing en­trance. ‘OK – I can hear Dum­ble­dore,’ said Hermione tense­ly. ‘Come on, Har­ry!’

They crept along the cor­ri­dor. The door opened. Dum­ble­dore’s back ap­peared.

‘I am go­ing to lock you in,’ they heard him say­ing. ‘It is five min­utes to mid­night. Miss Granger, three turns should do it. Good luck.’

Dum­ble­dore backed out of the room, closed the door and took out his wand to mag­ical­ly lock it. Pan­ick­ing, Har­ry and Hermione ran for­wards. Dum­ble­dore looked up, and a wide smile ap­peared un­der the long sil­ver mous­tache. ‘Well?’ he said qui­et­ly.

‘We did it!’ said Har­ry breath­less­ly. ‘Sir­ius has gone, on Buck­beak …’

Dum­ble­dore beamed at them.

‘Well done. I think –’ he lis­tened in­tent­ly for any sound with­in the hos­pi­tal wing. ‘Yes, I think you’ve gone, too. Get in­side – I’ll lock you in –’

Har­ry and Hermione slipped back in­side the dor­mi­to­ry. It was emp­ty ex­cept for Ron, who was still ly­ing mo­tion­less in the end bed. As the lock clicked be­hind them, Har­ry and Hermione crept back to their own beds, Hermione tuck­ing the Time-​Turn­er back un­der her robes. Next mo­ment, Madam Pom­frey had come strid­ing back out of her of­fice.

‘Did I hear the Head­mas­ter leav­ing? Am I al­lowed to look af­ter my pa­tients now?’

She was in a very bad mood. Har­ry and Hermione thought it best to ac­cept their choco­late qui­et­ly. Madam Pom­frey stood over them, mak­ing sure they ate it. But Har­ry could hard­ly swal­low. He and Hermione were wait­ing, lis­ten­ing, their nerves jan­gling … And then, as they both took a fourth piece of choco­late from Madam Pom­frey, they heard a dis­tant roar of fury echo­ing from some­where above them …

‘What was that?’ said Madam Pom­frey in alarm.

Now they could hear an­gry voic­es, grow­ing loud­er and loud­er. Madam Pom­frey was star­ing at the door.

‘Re­al­ly – they’ll wake ev­ery­body up! What do they think they’re do­ing?’

Har­ry was try­ing to hear what the voic­es were say­ing. They were draw­ing near­er –

‘He must have Dis­ap­pa­rat­ed, Severus, we should have left some­body in the room with him. When this gets out –’

‘HE DIDN’T DIS­AP­PA­RATE!’ Snape roared, now very close at hand. ‘YOU CAN’T AP­PA­RATE OR DIS­AP­PA­RATE IN­SIDE THIS CAS­TLE! THIS – HAS – SOME­THING – TO – DO – WITH – POT­TER!’

‘Severus – be rea­son­able – Har­ry has been locked up –’

BAM.

The door of the hos­pi­tal wing burst open.

Fudge, Snape and Dum­ble­dore came strid­ing in­to the ward. Dum­ble­dore alone looked calm. In­deed, he looked as though he was quite en­joy­ing him­self. Fudge ap­peared an­gry. But Snape was be­side him­self.

‘OUT WITH IT, POT­TER!’ he bel­lowed. ‘WHAT DID YOU DO?’

‘Pro­fes­sor Snape!’ shrieked Madam Pom­frey. ‘Con­trol your­self!’

‘See here, Snape, be rea­son­able,’ said Fudge. ‘This door’s been locked, we just saw –’

‘THEY HELPED HIM ES­CAPE, I KNOW IT!’ Snape howled, point­ing at Har­ry and Hermione. His face was twist­ed, spit was fly­ing from his mouth.

‘Calm down, man!’ Fudge barked. ‘You’re talk­ing non­sense!’

‘YOU DON’T KNOW POT­TER!’ shrieked Snape. ‘HE DID IT, I KNOW HE DID IT –’

‘That will do, Severus,’ said Dum­ble­dore qui­et­ly. ‘Think about what you are say­ing. This door has been locked since I left the ward ten min­utes ago. Madam Pom­frey, have these stu­dents left their beds?’

‘Of course not!’ said Madam Pom­frey, bristling. ‘I’ve been with them ev­er since you left!’

‘Well, there you have it, Severus,’ said Dum­ble­dore calm­ly. ‘Un­less you are sug­gest­ing that Har­ry and Hermione are able to be in two places at once, I’m afraid I don’t see any point in trou­bling them fur­ther.’

Snape stood there, seething, star­ing from Fudge, who looked thor­ough­ly shocked at his be­haviour, to Dum­ble­dore, whose eyes were twin­kling be­hind his glass­es. Snape whirled about, robes swish­ing be­hind him, and stormed out of the ward.

‘Fel­low seems quite un­bal­anced,’ said Fudge, star­ing af­ter him. ‘I’d watch out for him, if I were you, Dum­ble­dore.’

‘Oh, he’s not un­bal­anced,’ said Dum­ble­dore qui­et­ly. ‘He’s just suf­fered a se­vere dis­ap­point­ment.’

‘He’s not the on­ly one!’ puffed Fudge. ‘The Dai­ly Prophet’s go­ing to have a field day! We had Black cor­nered and he slipped through our fin­gers yet again! All it needs now is for the sto­ry of that Hip­pogriffs es­cape to get out, and I’ll be a laugh­ing stock! Well … I’d bet­ter go and no­ti­fy the Min­istry …’

‘And the De­men­tors?’ said Dum­ble­dore. ‘They’ll be re­moved from the school, I trust?’

‘Oh, yes, they’ll have to go,’ said Fudge, run­ning his fin­gers dis­tract­ed­ly through his hair. ‘Nev­er dreamed they’d at­tempt to ad­min­is­ter the Kiss on an in­no­cent boy … com­plete­ly out of con­trol … No, I’ll have them packed off back to Azk­aban tonight. Per­haps we should think about drag­ons at the school en­trance …’

‘Ha­grid would like that,’ said Dum­ble­dore, with a swift smile at Har­ry and Hermione. As he and Fudge left the dor­mi­to­ry, Madam Pom­frey hur­ried to the door and locked it again. Mut­ter­ing an­gri­ly to her­self, she head­ed back to her of­fice.

There was a low moan from the oth­er end of the ward. Ron had wo­ken up. They could see him sit­ting up, rub­bing his head, look­ing around.

‘What – what hap­pened?’ he groaned. ‘Har­ry? Why are we in here? Where’s Sir­ius? Where’s Lupin? What’s go­ing on?’

Har­ry and Hermione looked at each oth­er.

‘You ex­plain,’ said Har­ry, help­ing him­self to some more choco­late.

*

When Har­ry, Ron and Hermione left the hos­pi­tal wing at noon next day, it was to find an al­most de­sert­ed cas­tle. The swel­ter­ing heat and the end of the ex­ams meant that ev­ery­one was tak­ing full ad­van­tage of an­oth­er Hogsmeade vis­it. Nei­ther Ron nor Hermione felt like go­ing, how­ev­er, so they and Har­ry wan­dered in­to the grounds, still talk­ing about the ex­traor­di­nary events of the pre­vi­ous night and won­der­ing where Sir­ius and Buck­beak were now. Sit­ting near the lake, watch­ing the gi­ant squid wav­ing its ten­ta­cles lazi­ly above the wa­ter, Har­ry lost the thread of the con­ver­sa­tion as he looked across to the op­po­site bank. The stag had gal­loped to­wards him from there just last night …

A shad­ow fell across them and they looked up to see a very bleary-​eyed Ha­grid, mop­ping his sweaty face with one of his table­cloth-​sized hand­ker­chiefs and beam­ing down at them.

‘Know I shouldn’ feel hap­py, af­ter wha’ hap­pened las’ night,’ he said. ‘I mean, Black es­capin’ again, an’ ev­ery­thin’ – but guess what?’

‘What?’ they said, pre­tend­ing to look cu­ri­ous.

‘Beaky! He es­caped! He’s free! Bin cel­ebratin’ all night!’

‘That’s won­der­ful!’ said Hermione, giv­ing Ron a re­prov­ing look be­cause he looked as though he was close to laugh­ing.

‘Yeah … can’t’ve tied him up prop­er­ly,’ said Ha­grid, gaz­ing hap­pi­ly out over the grounds. ‘I was wor­ried this mornin’, mind … thought he migh­ta met Pro­fes­sor Lupin in the grounds, but Lupin says he nev­er ate any­thin’ las’ night …’

‘What?’ said Har­ry quick­ly.

‘Blimey, haven’ yeh heard?’ said Ha­grid, his smile fad­ing a lit­tle. He low­ered his voice, even though there was no­body in sight. ‘Er – Snape told all the Slytherins this mornin’ … thought ev­ery­one’d know by now … Pro­fes­sor Lupin’s a were­wolf, see. An’ he was loose in the grounds las’ night. He’s packin’ now, o’ course.’

‘He’s pack­ing?’ said Har­ry, alarmed. ‘Why?’

‘Leav­in’, isn’ he?’ said Ha­grid, look­ing sur­prised that Har­ry had to ask. ‘Re­signed firs’ thing this mornin’. Says he can’ risk it hap­penin’ again.’

Har­ry scram­bled to his feet.

‘I’m go­ing to see him,’ he said to Ron and Hermione.

‘But if he’s re­signed –’

‘– doesn’t sound like there’s any­thing we can do –’

‘I don’t care. I still want to see him. I’ll meet you back here.’

*

Lupin’s of­fice door was open. He had al­ready packed most of his things. The Grindy­low’s emp­ty tank stood next to his bat­tered old suit­case, which was open and near­ly full. Lupin was bend­ing over some­thing on his desk, and on­ly looked up when Har­ry knocked on the door.

‘I saw you com­ing,’ said Lupin, smil­ing. He point­ed to the parch­ment he had been por­ing over. It was the Ma­raud­er’s Map.

‘I just saw Ha­grid,’ said Har­ry. ‘And he said you’d re­signed. It’s not true, is it?’

‘I’m afraid it is,’ said Lupin. He start­ed open­ing his desk draw­ers and tak­ing out the con­tents.

‘Why?’ said Har­ry. ‘The Min­istry of Mag­ic don’t think you were help­ing Sir­ius, do they?’

Lupin crossed to the door and closed it be­hind Har­ry.

‘No. Pro­fes­sor Dum­ble­dore man­aged to con­vince Fudge that I was try­ing to save your lives.’ He sighed. ‘That was the fi­nal straw for Severus. I think the loss of the Or­der of Mer­lin hit him hard. So he – er – ac­ci­den­tal­ly let slip that I am a were­wolf this morn­ing at break­fast.’

‘You’re not leav­ing just be­cause of that!’ said Har­ry.

Lupin smiled wry­ly.

‘This time to­mor­row, the owls will start ar­riv­ing from par­ents – they will not want a were­wolf teach­ing their chil­dren, Har­ry. And af­ter last night, I see their point. I could have bit­ten any of you … that must nev­er hap­pen again.’

‘You’re the best De­fence Against the Dark Arts teach­er we’ve ev­er had!’ said Har­ry. ‘Don’t go!’

Lupin shook his head and didn’t speak. He car­ried on emp­ty­ing his draw­ers. Then, while Har­ry was try­ing to think of a good ar­gu­ment to make him stay, Lupin said, ‘From what the Head­mas­ter told me this morn­ing, you saved a lot of lives last night, Har­ry. If I’m proud of any­thing, it’s how much you’ve learned. Tell me about your Pa­tronus.’

‘How d’you know about that?’ said Har­ry, dis­tract­ed.

‘What else could have driv­en the De­men­tors back?’

Har­ry told Lupin what had hap­pened. When he’d fin­ished, Lupin was smil­ing again.

‘Yes, your fa­ther was al­ways a stag when he trans­formed,’ he said. ‘You guessed right … that’s why we called him Prongs.’

Lupin threw his last few books in­to his case, closed the desk draw­ers and turned to look at Har­ry.

‘Here – I brought this from the Shriek­ing Shack last night,’ he said, hand­ing Har­ry back the In­vis­ibil­ity Cloak. ‘And …’ he hes­itat­ed, then held out the Ma­raud­er’s Map, too. ‘I am no longer your teach­er, so I don’t feel guilty about giv­ing you this back as well. It’s no use to me, and I dare­say you, Ron and Hermione will find us­es for it.’

Har­ry took the map and grinned.

‘You told me Moony, Worm­tail, Pad­foot and Prongs would’ve want­ed to lure me out of school … you said they’d have thought it was fun­ny.’

‘And so we would have done,’ said Lupin, now reach­ing down to close his case. ‘I have no hes­ita­tion in say­ing that James would have been high­ly dis­ap­point­ed if his son had nev­er found any of the se­cret pas­sages out of the cas­tle.’

There was a knock on the door. Har­ry hasti­ly stuffed the Ma­raud­er’s Map and the In­vis­ibil­ity Cloak in­to his pock­et.

It was Pro­fes­sor Dum­ble­dore. He didn’t look sur­prised to see Har­ry there.

‘Your car­riage is at the gates, Re­mus,’ he said.

‘Thank you, Head­mas­ter.’

Lupin picked up his old suit­case and the emp­ty Grindy­low tank.

‘Well – good­bye, Har­ry’ he said, smil­ing. ‘It has been a re­al plea­sure teach­ing you. I feel sure we’ll meet again some time. Head­mas­ter, there is no need to see me to the gates, I can man­age …’

Har­ry had the im­pres­sion that Lupin want­ed to leave as quick­ly as pos­si­ble.

‘Good­bye, then, Re­mus,’ said Dum­ble­dore sober­ly. Lupin shift­ed the Grindy­low tank slight­ly so that he and Dum­ble­dore could shake hands. Then, with a fi­nal nod to Har­ry, and a swift smile, Lupin left the of­fice.

Har­ry sat down in his va­cat­ed chair, star­ing glum­ly at the floor. He heard the door close and looked up. Dum­ble­dore was still there.

‘Why so mis­er­able, Har­ry?’ he said qui­et­ly. ‘You should be very proud of your­self af­ter last night.’

‘It didn’t make any dif­fer­ence,’ said Har­ry bit­ter­ly. ‘Pet­ti­grew got away.’

‘Didn’t make any dif­fer­ence?’ said Dum­ble­dore qui­et­ly. ‘It made all the dif­fer­ence in the world, Har­ry. You helped un­cov­er the truth. You saved an in­no­cent man from a ter­ri­ble fate.’

Ter­ri­ble. Some­thing stirred in Har­ry’s mem­ory. Greater and more ter­ri­ble than ev­er be­fore … Pro­fes­sor Trelawney’s pre­dic­tion!

‘Pro­fes­sor Dum­ble­dore – yes­ter­day, when I was hav­ing my Div­ina­tion ex­am, Pro­fes­sor Trelawney went very – very strange.’

‘In­deed?’ said Dum­ble­dore. ‘Er – stranger than usu­al, you mean?’

‘Yes … her voice went all deep and her eyes rolled and she said … she said Volde­mort’s ser­vant was go­ing to set out to re­turn to him be­fore mid­night … she said the ser­vant would help him come back to pow­er.’ Har­ry stared up at Dum­ble­dore. ‘And then she sort of be­came nor­mal again, and she couldn’t re­mem­ber any­thing she’d said. Was it – was she mak­ing a re­al pre­dic­tion?’

Dum­ble­dore looked mild­ly im­pressed.

‘Do you know, Har­ry, I think she might have been,’ he said thought­ful­ly. ‘Who’d have thought it? That brings her to­tal of re­al pre­dic­tions up to two. I should of­fer her a pay rise …’

‘But –’ Har­ry looked at him, aghast. How could Dum­ble­dore take this so calm­ly?

‘But – I stopped Sir­ius and Pro­fes­sor Lupin killing Pet­ti­grew! That makes it my fault, if Volde­mort comes back!’

‘It does not,’ said Dum­ble­dore qui­et­ly. ‘Hasn’t your ex­pe­ri­ence with the Time-​Turn­er taught you any­thing, Har­ry? The con­se­quences of our ac­tions are al­ways so com­pli­cat­ed, so di­verse, that pre­dict­ing the fu­ture is a very dif­fi­cult busi­ness in­deed … Pro­fes­sor Trelawney, bless her, is liv­ing proof of that. You did a very no­ble thing, in sav­ing Pet­ti­grew’s life.’

‘But if he helps Volde­mort back to pow­er –!’

‘Pet­ti­grew owes his life to you. You have sent Volde­mort a deputy who is in your debt. When one wiz­ard saves an­oth­er wiz­ard’s life, it cre­ates a cer­tain bond be­tween them … and I’m much mis­tak­en if Volde­mort wants his ser­vant in the debt of Har­ry Pot­ter.’

‘I don’t want a bond with Pet­ti­grew!’ said Har­ry. ‘He be­trayed my par­ents!’

‘This is mag­ic at its deep­est, its most im­pen­etra­ble, Har­ry. But trust me … the time may come when you will be very glad you saved Pet­ti­grew’s life.’

Har­ry couldn’t imag­ine when that would be. Dum­ble­dore looked as though he knew what Har­ry was think­ing.

‘I knew your fa­ther very well, both at Hog­warts and lat­er, Har­ry,’ he said gen­tly. ‘He would have saved Pet­ti­grew too, I am sure of it.’

Har­ry looked up at him. Dum­ble­dore wouldn’t laugh – he could tell Dum­ble­dore …

‘Last night … I thought it was my dad who’d con­jured my Pa­tronus. I mean, when I saw my­self across the lake … I thought I was see­ing him.’

‘An easy mis­take to make,’ said Dum­ble­dore soft­ly. ‘I ex­pect you’re tired of hear­ing it, but you do look ex­traor­di­nar­ily like James. Ex­cept for your eyes … you have your moth­er’s eyes.’

Har­ry shook his head.

‘It was stupid, think­ing it was him,’ he mut­tered. ‘I mean, I knew he was dead.’

‘You think the dead we have loved ev­er tru­ly leave us? You think that we don’t re­call them more clear­ly than ev­er in times of great trou­ble? Your fa­ther is alive in you, Har­ry, and shows him­self most plain­ly when you have need of him. How else could you pro­duce that par­tic­ular Pa­tronus? Prongs rode again last night.’

It took a mo­ment for Har­ry to re­alise what Dum­ble­dore had said.

‘Sir­ius told me all about how they be­came An­ima­gi last night,’ said Dum­ble­dore, smil­ing. ‘An ex­traor­di­nary achieve­ment – not least, keep­ing it qui­et from me. And then I re­mem­bered the most un­usu­al form your Pa­tronus took, when it charged Mr Mal­foy down at your Quid­ditch match against Raven­claw. So you did see your fa­ther last night, Har­ry … you found him in­side your­self.’

And Dum­ble­dore left the of­fice, leav­ing Har­ry to his very con­fused thoughts.

*

No­body at Hog­warts knew the truth of what had hap­pened the night that Sir­ius, Buck­beak and Pet­ti­grew had van­ished ex­cept Har­ry, Ron, Hermione and Pro­fes­sor Dum­ble­dore. As the end of term ap­proached, Har­ry heard many dif­fer­ent the­ories about what had re­al­ly hap­pened, but none of them came close to the truth.

Mal­foy was fu­ri­ous about Buck­beak. He was con­vinced that Ha­grid had found a way of smug­gling the Hip­pogriff to safe­ty, and seemed out­raged that he and his fa­ther had been out­wit­ted by a game­keep­er. Per­cy Weasley, mean­while, had much to say on the sub­ject of Sir­ius’s es­cape.

‘If I man­age to get in­to the Min­istry, I’ll have a lot of pro­pos­als to make about Mag­ical Law En­force­ment!’ he told the on­ly per­son who would lis­ten – his girl­friend, Pene­lope.

Though the weath­er was per­fect, though the at­mo­sphere was so cheer­ful, though he knew they had achieved the near im­pos­si­ble in help­ing Sir­ius to free­dom, Har­ry had nev­er ap­proached the end of a school year in worse spir­its.

He cer­tain­ly wasn’t the on­ly one who was sor­ry to see Pro­fes­sor Lupin go. The whole of Har­ry’s De­fence Against the Dark Arts class were mis­er­able about his res­ig­na­tion.

‘Won­der what they’ll give us next year?’ said Sea­mus Finni­gan gloomi­ly.

‘Maybe a vam­pire,’ sug­gest­ed Dean Thomas hope­ful­ly.

It wasn’t on­ly Pro­fes­sor Lupin’s de­par­ture that was weigh­ing on Har­ry’s mind. He couldn’t help think­ing a lot about Pro­fes­sor Trelawney’s pre­dic­tion. He kept won­der­ing where Pet­ti­grew was now, whether he had sought sanc­tu­ary with Volde­mort yet. But the thing that was low­er­ing Har­ry’s spir­its most of all was the prospect of re­turn­ing to the Durs­leys. For maybe half an hour, a glo­ri­ous half-​hour, he had be­lieved he would be liv­ing with Sir­ius from now on … his par­ents’ best friend … it would have been the next best thing to hav­ing his own fa­ther back. And while no news of Sir­ius was def­inite­ly good news, be­cause it meant he had suc­cess­ful­ly gone in­to hid­ing, Har­ry couldn’t help feel­ing mis­er­able when he thought of the home he might have had, and the fact that it was now im­pos­si­ble.

The ex­am re­sults came out on the last day of term. Har­ry, Ron and Hermione had passed ev­ery sub­ject. Har­ry was amazed that he had got through Po­tions. He had a shrewd sus­pi­cion that Dum­ble­dore had stepped in to stop Snape fail­ing him on pur­pose. Snape’s be­haviour to­wards Har­ry over the past week had been quite alarm­ing. Har­ry wouldn’t have thought it pos­si­ble that Snape’s dis­like for him could in­crease, but it cer­tain­ly had done. A mus­cle twitched un­pleas­ant­ly at the cor­ner of Snape’s thin mouth ev­ery time he looked at Har­ry, and he was con­stant­ly flex­ing his fin­gers, as though itch­ing to place them around Har­ry’s throat.

Per­cy had got his top-​grade NEWTs; Fred and George had scraped a hand­ful of OWLs each. Gryffind­or house, mean­while, large­ly thanks to their spec­tac­ular per­for­mance in the Quid­ditch Cup, had won the House Cham­pi­onship for the third year run­ning. This meant that the end-​of-​term feast took place amid dec­ora­tions of scar­let and gold, and that the Gryffind­or ta­ble was the nois­iest of the lot, as ev­ery­body cel­ebrat­ed. Even Har­ry man­aged to for­get about the jour­ney back to the Durs­leys next day as he ate, drank, talked and laughed with the rest.

*

As the Hog­warts Ex­press pulled out of the sta­tion next morn­ing, Hermione gave Har­ry and Ron some sur­pris­ing news.

‘I went to see Pro­fes­sor McG­ona­gall this morn­ing, just be­fore break­fast. I’ve de­cid­ed to drop Mug­gle Stud­ies.’

‘But you passed your ex­am with three hun­dred and twen­ty per cent!’ said Ron.

‘I know,’ sighed Hermione, ‘but I can’t stand an­oth­er year like this one. That Time-​Turn­er, it was driv­ing me mad. I’ve hand­ed it in. With­out Mug­gle Stud­ies and Div­ina­tion, I’ll be able to have a nor­mal timetable again.’

‘I still can’t be­lieve you didn’t tell us about it,’ said Ron grumpi­ly. ‘We’re sup­posed to be your friends.’

‘I promised I wouldn’t tell any­one,’ said Hermione severe­ly. She looked around at Har­ry, who was watch­ing Hog­warts dis­ap­pear from view be­hind a moun­tain. Two whole months be­fore he’d see it again …

‘Oh, cheer up, Har­ry!’ said Hermione sad­ly.

‘I’m OK,’ said Har­ry quick­ly. ‘Just think­ing about the hol­idays.’

‘Yeah, I’ve been think­ing about them, too,’ said Ron. ‘Har­ry, you’ve got to come and stay with us. I’ll fix it up with Mum and Dad, then I’ll call you. I know how to use a fel­ly tone now –’

‘A tele­phone, Ron,’ said Hermione. ‘Hon­est­ly, you should take Mug­gle Stud­ies next year …’

Ron ig­nored her.

‘It’s the Quid­ditch World Cup this sum­mer! How about it, Har­ry? Come and stay, and we’ll go and see it! Dad can usu­al­ly get tick­ets from work.’

This pro­pos­al had the ef­fect of cheer­ing Har­ry up a great deal.

‘Yeah … I bet the Durs­leys’d be pleased to let me come … es­pe­cial­ly af­ter what I did to Aunt Marge …’

Feel­ing con­sid­er­ably more cheer­ful, Har­ry joined Ron and Hermione in sev­er­al games of Ex­plod­ing Snap, and when the witch with the tea trol­ley ar­rived, he bought him­self a very large lunch, though noth­ing with choco­late in it.

But it was late in the af­ter­noon be­fore the thing that made him tru­ly hap­py turned up …

‘Har­ry,’ said Hermione sud­den­ly, peer­ing over his shoul­der. ‘What’s that thing out­side your win­dow?’

Har­ry turned to look out­side. Some­thing very small and grey was bob­bing in and out of sight be­yond the glass. He stood up for a bet­ter look and saw that it was a tiny owl, car­ry­ing a let­ter which was much too big for it. The owl was so small, in fact, that it kept tum­bling over in the air, buf­fet­ed this way and that in the train’s slip­stream. Har­ry quick­ly pulled down the win­dow, stretched out his arm and caught it. It felt like a very fluffy Snitch. He brought it care­ful­ly in­side. The owl dropped its let­ter on­to Har­ry’s seat and be­gan zoom­ing around their com­part­ment, ap­par­ent­ly very pleased with it­self for ac­com­plish­ing its task. Hed­wig clicked her beak with a sort of dig­ni­fied dis­ap­proval. Crook­shanks sat up in his seat, fol­low­ing the owl with his great yel­low eyes. Ron, notic­ing this, snatched the owl safe­ly out of harm’s way.

Har­ry picked up the let­ter. It was ad­dressed to him. He ripped open the let­ter and shout­ed, ‘It’s from Sir­ius!’

‘What?’ said Ron and Hermione ex­cit­ed­ly. ‘Read it aloud!’



Dear Har­ry,

I hope this finds you be­fore you reach your aunt and un­cle. I don’t know whether they’re used to owl post.

Buck­beak and I are in hid­ing. I won’t tell you where, in case this falls in­to the wrong hands. I have some doubt about the owl’s re­li­abil­ity, but he is the best I could find, and he did seem ea­ger for the job.

I be­lieve the De­men­tors are still search­ing for me, but they haven’t a hope of find­ing me here. I am plan­ning to al­low some Mug­gles to glimpse me soon, a long way from Hog­warts, so that the se­cu­ri­ty on the cas­tle will be lift­ed.

There is some­thing I nev­er got round to telling you dur­ing our brief meet­ing. It was I who sent you the Fire­bolt –



‘Ha!’ said Hermione tri­umphant­ly. ‘See! I told you it was from him!’

‘Yes, but he hadn’t jinxed it, had he?’ said Ron. ‘Ouch!’

The tiny owl, now hoot­ing hap­pi­ly in his hand, had nib­bled one of his fin­gers in what it seemed to think was an af­fec­tion­ate way.



Crook­shanks took the or­der to the Owl Of­fice for me. I used your name but told them to take the gold from Gringotts vault num­ber sev­en hun­dred and eleven – my own. Please con­sid­er it as thir­teen birth­days’ worth of presents from your god­fa­ther.

I would al­so like to apol­ogise for the fright I think I gave you, that night last year when you left your un­cle’s house. I had on­ly hoped to get a glimpse of you be­fore start­ing my jour­ney north, but I think the sight of me alarmed you.

I am en­clos­ing some­thing else for you, which I think will make your next year at Hog­warts more en­joy­able.

If ev­er you need me, send word. Your owl will find me.

I’ll write again soon.

Sir­ius



Har­ry looked ea­ger­ly in­side the en­ve­lope. There was an­oth­er piece of parch­ment in there. He read it through quick­ly and felt sud­den­ly as warm and con­tent­ed as though he’d swal­lowed a bot­tle of hot But­ter­beer in one go.



I, Sir­ius Black, Har­ry Pot­ter’s god­fa­ther, here­by give him per­mis­sion to vis­it Hogsmeade at week­ends.



‘That’ll be good enough for Dum­ble­dore!’ said Har­ry hap­pi­ly. He looked back at Sir­ius’s let­ter. ‘Hang on, there’s a PS …



I thought your friend Ron might like to keep this owl, as it’s my fault he no longer has a rat.



Ron’s eyes widened. The minute owl was still hoot­ing ex­cit­ed­ly.

‘Keep him?’ he said un­cer­tain­ly. He looked close­ly at the owl for a mo­ment, then, to Har­ry and Hermione’s great sur­prise, he held him out for Crook­shanks to sniff.

‘What d’you reck­on?’ Ron asked the cat. ‘Def­inite­ly an owl?’

Crook­shanks purred.

‘That’s good enough for me,’ said Ron hap­pi­ly. ‘He’s mine.’

Har­ry read and re-​read the let­ter from Sir­ius all the way back in­to King’s Cross Sta­tion. It was still clutched tight­ly in his hand as he, Ron and Hermione stepped back through the bar­ri­er of plat­form nine and three-​quar­ters. Har­ry spot­ted Un­cle Ver­non at once. He was stand­ing a good dis­tance from Mr and Mrs Weasley, eye­ing them sus­pi­cious­ly, and when Mrs Weasley hugged Har­ry in greet­ing, his worst sus­pi­cions about them seemed con­firmed.

‘I’ll call about the World Cup!’ Ron yelled af­ter Har­ry, as Har­ry bid him and Hermione good­bye, then wheeled the trol­ley bear­ing his trunk and Hed­wig’s cage to­wards Un­cle Ver­non, who greet­ed him in usu­al fash­ion.

‘What’s that?’ he snarled, star­ing at the en­ve­lope Har­ry was still clutch­ing in his hand. ‘If it’s an­oth­er form for me to sign, you’ve got an­oth­er –’

‘It’s not,’ said Har­ry cheer­ful­ly. ‘It’s a let­ter from my god­fa­ther.’

‘God­fa­ther?’ splut­tered Un­cle Ver­non. ‘You haven’t got a god­fa­ther!’

‘Yes, I have,’ said Har­ry bright­ly. ‘He was my mum and dad’s best friend. He’s a con­vict­ed mur­der­er, but he’s bro­ken out of wiz­ard prison and he’s on the run. He likes to keep in touch with me, though … keep up with my news … check I’m hap­py …’

And grin­ning broad­ly at the look of hor­ror on Un­cle Ver­non’s face, Har­ry set off to­wards the sta­tion ex­it, Hed­wig rat­tling along in front of him, for what looked like a much bet­ter sum­mer than the last.
