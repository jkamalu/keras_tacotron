CHAPTER THREE


The Knight Bus



Har­ry was sev­er­al streets away be­fore he col­lapsed on­to a low wall in Mag­no­lia Cres­cent, pant­ing from the ef­fort of drag­ging his trunk. He sat quite still, anger still surg­ing through him, lis­ten­ing to the fran­tic thump­ing of his heart.

But af­ter ten min­utes alone in the dark street, a new emo­tion over­took him: pan­ic. Whichev­er way he looked at it, he had nev­er been in a worse fix. He was strand­ed, quite alone, in the dark Mug­gle world, with ab­so­lute­ly nowhere to go. And the worst of it was, he had just done se­ri­ous mag­ic, which meant that he was al­most cer­tain­ly ex­pelled from Hog­warts. He had bro­ken the De­cree for the Re­stric­tion of Un­der­age Wiz­ardry so bad­ly, he was sur­prised Min­istry of Mag­ic rep­re­sen­ta­tives weren’t swoop­ing down on him where he sat.

Har­ry shiv­ered and looked up and down Mag­no­lia Cres­cent. What was go­ing to hap­pen to him? Would he be ar­rest­ed, or would he sim­ply be out­lawed from the wiz­ard­ing world? He thought of Ron and Hermione, and his heart sank even low­er. Har­ry was sure that, crim­inal or not, Ron and Hermione would want to help him now, but they were both abroad, and with Hed­wig gone, he had no means of con­tact­ing them.

He didn’t have any Mug­gle mon­ey, ei­ther. There was a lit­tle wiz­ard gold in the mon­ey­bag at the bot­tom of his trunk, but the rest of the for­tune his par­ents had left him was stored in a vault at Gringotts Wiz­ard­ing Bank in Lon­don. He’d nev­er be able to drag his trunk all the way to Lon­don. Un­less …

He looked down at his wand, which he was still clutch­ing in his hand. If he was al­ready ex­pelled (his heart was now thump­ing painful­ly fast), a bit more mag­ic couldn’t hurt. He had the In­vis­ibil­ity Cloak he had in­her­it­ed from his fa­ther – what if he be­witched the trunk to make it feath­er-​light, tied it to his broom­stick, cov­ered him­self in the Cloak and flew to Lon­don? Then he could get the rest of his mon­ey out of his vault and … be­gin his life as an out­cast. It was a hor­ri­ble prospect, but he couldn’t sit on this wall for ev­er or he’d find him­self try­ing to ex­plain to Mug­gle po­lice why he was out in the dead of night with a trunk­ful of spell­books and a broom­stick.

Har­ry opened his trunk again and pushed the con­tents aside, look­ing for the In­vis­ibil­ity Cloak – but be­fore he had found it, he straight­ened up sud­den­ly, look­ing around him once more.

A fun­ny prick­ling on the back of his neck had made Har­ry feel he was be­ing watched, but the street ap­peared to be de­sert­ed, and no lights shone from any of the large square hous­es.

He bent over his trunk again, but al­most im­me­di­ate­ly stood up once more, his hand clenched on his wand. He had sensed rather than heard it: some­one or some­thing was stand­ing in the nar­row gap be­tween the garage and the fence be­hind him. Har­ry squint­ed at the black al­ley­way. If on­ly it would move, then he’d know whether it was just a stray cat or – some­thing else.

‘Lu­mos,’ Har­ry mut­tered, and a light ap­peared at the end of his wand, al­most daz­zling him. He held it high over his head, and the peb­ble-​dashed walls of num­ber two sud­den­ly sparkled; the garage door gleamed, and be­tween them, Har­ry saw, quite dis­tinct­ly, the hulk­ing out­line of some­thing very big, with wide, gleam­ing eyes.

Har­ry stepped back­wards. His legs hit his trunk and he tripped. His wand flew out of his hand as he flung out an arm to break his fall, and he land­ed, hard, in the gut­ter.

There was a deaf­en­ing BANG and Har­ry threw up his hands to shield his eyes against a sud­den blind­ing light …

With a yell, he rolled back on­to the pave­ment, just in time. A sec­ond lat­er, a gi­gan­tic pair of wheels and head­lights had screeched to a halt ex­act­ly where Har­ry had just been ly­ing. They be­longed, as Har­ry saw when he raised his head, to a triple-​deck­er, vi­olent­ly pur­ple bus, which had ap­peared out of thin air. Gold let­ter­ing over the wind­screen spelled The Knight Bus.

For a split sec­ond, Har­ry won­dered if he had been knocked sil­ly by his fall. Then a con­duc­tor in a pur­ple uni­form leapt out of the bus and be­gan to speak loud­ly to the night.

‘Wel­come to the Knight Bus, emer­gen­cy trans­port for the strand­ed witch or wiz­ard. Just stick out your wand hand, step on board and we can take you any­where you want to go. My name is Stan Shun­pike, and I will be your con­duc­tor this eve –’

The con­duc­tor stopped abrupt­ly. He had just caught sight of Har­ry, who was still sit­ting on the ground. Har­ry snatched up his wand again and scram­bled to his feet. Close to, he saw that Stan Shun­pike was on­ly a few years old­er than he was; eigh­teen or nine­teen at most, with large, pro­trud­ing ears and a fair few pim­ples.

‘What were you doin’ down there?’ said Stan, drop­ping his pro­fes­sion­al man­ner.

‘Fell over,’ said Har­ry.

‘’Choo fall over for?’ snig­gered Stan.

‘I didn’t do it on pur­pose,’ said Har­ry, an­noyed. One of the knees in his jeans was torn, and the hand he had thrown out to break his fall was bleed­ing. He sud­den­ly re­mem­bered why he had fall­en over, and turned around quick­ly to stare at the al­ley­way be­tween the garage and fence. The Knight Bus’s head­lamps were flood­ing it with light, and it was emp­ty.

‘’Choo lookin’ at?’ said Stan.

‘There was a big black thing,’ said Har­ry, point­ing un­cer­tain­ly in­to the gap. ‘Like a dog … but mas­sive …’

He looked around at Stan, whose mouth was slight­ly open. With a feel­ing of un­ease, Har­ry saw Stan’s eyes move to the scar on Har­ry’s fore­head.

‘Woss that on your ’ead?’ said Stan abrupt­ly.

‘Noth­ing,’ said Har­ry quick­ly, flat­ten­ing his hair over his scar. If the Min­istry of Mag­ic was look­ing for him, he didn’t want to make it too easy for them.

‘Woss your name?’ Stan per­sist­ed.

‘Neville Long­bot­tom,’ said Har­ry, say­ing the first name that came in­to his head. ‘So – so this bus,’ he went on quick­ly, hop­ing to dis­tract Stan, ‘did you say it goes any­where?’

‘Yep,’ said Stan proud­ly, ‘any­where you like, long’s it’s on land. Can’t do nuffink un­der­wa­ter. ’Ere,’ he said, look­ing sus­pi­cious again, ‘you did flag us down, din­cha? Stuck out your wand ’and, din­cha?’

‘Yes,’ said Har­ry quick­ly. ‘Lis­ten, how much would it be to get to Lon­don?’

‘Eleven Sick­les,’ said Stan, ‘but for fir­teen you get ’ot choco­late, and for fif­teen you get an ’ot-​wa­ter bot­tle an’ a toof­brush in the colour of your choice.’

Har­ry rum­maged once more in his trunk, ex­tract­ed his mon­ey bag and shoved some sil­ver in­to Stan’s hand. He and Stan then lift­ed his trunk, with Hed­wig’s cage bal­anced on top, up the steps of the bus.

There were no seats; in­stead, half-​a-​dozen brass bed­steads stood be­side the cur­tained win­dows. Can­dles were burn­ing in brack­ets be­side each bed, il­lu­mi­nat­ing the wood-​pan­elled walls. A tiny wiz­ard in a night­cap at the rear of the bus mut­tered, ‘Not now, thanks, I’m pick­ling some slugs,’ and rolled over in his sleep.

‘You ’ave this one,’ Stan whis­pered, shov­ing Har­ry’s trunk un­der the bed right be­hind the driv­er, who was sit­ting in an arm­chair in front of the steer­ing wheel. ‘This is our driv­er, Ernie Prang. This is Neville Long­bot­tom, Ern.’

Ernie Prang, an el­der­ly wiz­ard wear­ing very thick glass­es, nod­ded to Har­ry, who ner­vous­ly flat­tened his fringe again and sat down on his bed.

‘Take ’er away, Ern,’ said Stan, sit­ting down in the arm­chair next to Ernie’s.

There was an­oth­er tremen­dous BANG, and next mo­ment Har­ry found him­self flat on his bed, thrown back­wards by the speed of the Knight Bus. Pulling him­self up, Har­ry stared out of the dark win­dow and saw that they were now bowl­ing along a com­plete­ly dif­fer­ent street. Stan was watch­ing Har­ry’s stunned face with great en­joy­ment.

‘This is where we was be­fore you flagged us down,’ he said. ‘Where are we, Ern? Some­where in Wales?’

‘Ar,’ said Ernie.

‘How come the Mug­gles don’t hear the bus?’ said Har­ry.

‘Them!’ said Stan con­temp­tu­ous­ly. ‘Don’ lis­ten prop­er­ly, do they? Don’ look prop­er­ly ei­ther. Nev­er no­tice nuffink, they don’.’

‘Best go wake up Madam Marsh, Stan,’ said Ern. ‘We’ll be in Aber­gaven­ny in a minute.’

Stan passed Har­ry’s bed and dis­ap­peared up a nar­row wood­en stair­case. Har­ry was still look­ing out of the win­dow, feel­ing in­creas­ing­ly ner­vous. Ernie didn’t seem to have mas­tered the use of a steer­ing wheel. The Knight Bus kept mount­ing the pave­ment, but it didn’t hit any­thing; lines of lamp posts, let­ter box­es and bins jumped out of its way as it ap­proached and back in­to po­si­tion once it had passed.

Stan came back down­stairs, fol­lowed by a faint­ly green witch wrapped in a trav­el­ling cloak.

‘’Ere you go, Madam Marsh,’ said Stan hap­pi­ly, as Ern stamped on the brake and the beds slid a foot or so to­wards the front of the bus. Madam Marsh clamped a hand­ker­chief to her mouth and tot­tered down the steps. Stan threw her bag out af­ter her and rammed the doors shut; there was an­oth­er loud BANG, and they were thun­der­ing down a nar­row coun­try lane, trees leap­ing out of the way.

Har­ry wouldn’t have been able to sleep even if he had been trav­el­ling on a bus that didn’t keep bang­ing loud­ly and jump­ing a hun­dred miles at a time. His stom­ach churned as he fell back to won­der­ing what was go­ing to hap­pen to him, and whether the Durs­leys had man­aged to get Aunt Marge off the ceil­ing yet.

Stan had un­furled a copy of the Dai­ly Prophet and was now read­ing with his tongue be­tween his teeth. A large pho­to­graph of a sunken-​faced man with long, mat­ted hair blinked slow­ly at Har­ry from the front page. He looked strange­ly fa­mil­iar.

‘That man!’ Har­ry said, for­get­ting his trou­bles for a mo­ment. ‘He was on the Mug­gle news!’

Stan­ley turned to the front page and chuck­led.

‘Sir­ius Black,’ he said, nod­ding. ‘’Course ’e was on the Mug­gle news, Neville. Where you been?’

He gave a su­pe­ri­or sort of chuck­le at the blank look on Har­ry’s face, re­moved the front page and hand­ed it to Har­ry.

‘You ough­ta read the pa­pers more, Neville.’

Har­ry held the pa­per up to the can­dle­light and read:



BLACK STILL AT LARGE

Sir­ius Black, pos­si­bly the most in­fa­mous pris­on­er ev­er to be held in Azk­aban fortress, is still elud­ing cap­ture, the Min­istry of Mag­ic con­firmed to­day.

‘We are do­ing all we can to re­cap­ture Black,’ said the Min­is­ter for Mag­ic, Cor­nelius Fudge, this morn­ing, ‘and we beg the mag­ical com­mu­ni­ty to re­main calm.’

Fudge has been crit­icised by some mem­bers of the In­ter­na­tion­al Fed­er­ation of War­locks for in­form­ing the Mug­gle Prime Min­is­ter of the cri­sis.

‘Well, re­al­ly, I had to, don’t you know,’ said an ir­ri­ta­ble Fudge. ‘Black is mad. He’s a dan­ger to any­one who cross­es him, mag­ic or Mug­gle. I have the Prime Min­is­ter’s as­sur­ance that he will not breathe a word of Black’s true iden­ti­ty to any­one. And let’s face it – who’d be­lieve him if he did?’

‘While Mug­gles have been told that Black is car­ry­ing a gun (a kind of met­al wand which Mug­gles use to kill each oth­er), the mag­ical com­mu­ni­ty lives in fear of a mas­sacre like that of twelve years ago, when Black mur­dered thir­teen peo­ple with a sin­gle curse.’



Har­ry looked in­to the shad­owed eyes of Sir­ius Black, the on­ly part of the sunken face that seemed alive. Har­ry had nev­er met a vam­pire, but he had seen pic­tures of them in his De­fence Against the Dark Arts class­es, and Black, with his waxy white skin, looked just like one.

‘Scary-​lookin’ fing, in­ee?’ said Stan, who had been watch­ing Har­ry read.

‘He mur­dered thir­teen peo­ple?’ said Har­ry, hand­ing the page back to Stan, ‘with one curse?’

‘Yep,’ said Stan. ‘In front of wit­ness­es an’ all. Broad day­light. Big trou­ble it caused, din­nit, Ern?’

‘Ar,’ said Ern dark­ly.

Stan swiv­elled in his arm­chair, his hands on the back, the bet­ter to look at Har­ry.

‘Black woz a big sup­port­er of You-​Know-’Oo,’ he said.

‘What, Volde­mort?’ said Har­ry, with­out think­ing.

Even Stan’s pim­ples went white; Ern jerked the steer­ing wheel so hard that a whole farm­house had to jump aside to avoid the bus.

‘You out­ta your tree?’ yelped Stan. ‘’Choo say ’is name for?’

‘Sor­ry,’ said Har­ry hasti­ly. ‘Sor­ry, I – I for­got –’

‘For­got!’ said Stan weak­ly. ‘Blimey, my ’eart’s goin’ that fast …’

‘So – so Black was a sup­port­er of You-​Know-​Who?’ Har­ry prompt­ed apolo­get­ical­ly.

‘Yeah,’ said Stan, still rub­bing his chest. ‘Yeah, that’s right. Very close to You-​Know-’Oo, they say … any­way, when lit­tle ’Ar­ry Pot­ter put paid to You-​Know-’Oo’ – Har­ry ner­vous­ly flat­tened his fringe down again – ‘all You-​Know-’Oo’s sup­port­ers was tracked down, wasn’t they, Ern? Most of ’em knew it was all over, wiv You-​Know-’Oo gone, and they came qui­et. But not Sir­ius Black. I ’eard he thought ’e’d be sec­ond-​in-​com­mand once You-​Know-’Oo ’ad tak­en over.

‘Any­way, they cor­nered Black in the mid­dle of a street full of Mug­gles an’ Black took out ’is wand and ’e blast­ed ’alf the street apart, an’ a wiz­ard got it, an’ so did a dozen Mug­gles what got in the way. ’Or­ri­ble, eh? An’ you know what Black did then?’ Stan con­tin­ued in a dra­mat­ic whis­per.

‘What?’ said Har­ry.

‘Laughed,’ said Stan. ‘Jus’ stood there an’ laughed. An’ when re­in­force­ments from the Min­istry of Mag­ic got there, ’e went wiv ’em qui­et as anyfink, still laugh­ing ’is ’ead off. ’Cos ’e’s mad, in­ee, Ern? In­ee mad?’

‘If he weren’t when he went to Azk­aban, he will be now,’ said Ern in his slow voice. ‘I’d blow me­self up be­fore I set foot in that place. Serves him right, mind … af­ter what he did …’

‘They ’ad a job cov­erin’ it up, din’ they, Ern?’ Stan said. ‘’Ole street blown up an’ all them Mug­gles dead. What was it they said ’ad ’ap­pened, Ern?’

‘Gas ex­plo­sion,’ grunt­ed Ernie.

‘An’ now ’e’s out,’ said Stan, ex­am­in­ing the news­pa­per pic­ture of Black’s gaunt face again. ‘Nev­er been a break­out from Azk­aban be­fore, ’as there, Ern? Beats me ’ow ’e did it. Fright­enin’, eh? Mind, I don’t fan­cy ’is chances against them Azk­aban guards, eh, Ern?’

Ernie sud­den­ly shiv­ered.

‘Talk about sum­mat else, Stan, there’s a good lad. Them Azk­aban guards give me the col­ly­wob­bles.’

Stan put the pa­per away re­luc­tant­ly and Har­ry leaned against the win­dow of the Knight Bus, feel­ing worse than ev­er. He couldn’t help imag­in­ing what Stan might be telling his pas­sen­gers in a few nights’ time.

‘’Ear about that ’Ar­ry Pot­ter? Blew up ’is Aunt! We ’ad ’im ’ere on the Knight Bus, di’n’t we, Ern? ’E was tryin’ to run for it …’

He, Har­ry, had bro­ken wiz­ard law just like Sir­ius Black. Was in­flat­ing Aunt Marge bad enough to land him in Azk­aban? Har­ry didn’t know any­thing about the wiz­ard prison, though ev­ery­one he’d ev­er heard speak of it did so in the same fear­ful tone. Ha­grid the Hog­warts game­keep­er had spend two months there on­ly last year. Har­ry wouldn’t soon for­get the look of ter­ror on Ha­grid’s face when he had been told where he was go­ing, and Ha­grid was one of the bravest peo­ple Har­ry knew.

The Knight Bus rolled through the dark­ness, scat­ter­ing bush­es and bol­lards, tele­phone box­es and trees, and Har­ry lay, rest­less and mis­er­able, on his feath­er bed. Af­ter a while, Stan re­mem­bered that Har­ry had paid for hot choco­late, but poured it all over Har­ry’s pil­low when the bus moved abrupt­ly from An­gle­sea to Ab­erdeen. One by one, wiz­ards and witch­es in dress­ing gowns and slip­pers de­scend­ed from the up­per floors to leave the bus. They all looked very pleased to go.

Fi­nal­ly, Har­ry was the on­ly pas­sen­ger left.

‘Right then, Neville,’ said Stan, clap­ping his hands, ‘where­abouts in Lon­don?’

‘Di­agon Al­ley’ said Har­ry.

‘Righto,’ said Stan, ‘’old tight, then …’

BANG

They were thun­der­ing along Char­ing Cross Road. Har­ry sat up and watched build­ings and bench­es squeez­ing them­selves out of the Knight Bus’s way. The sky was get­ting a lit­tle lighter. He would lie low for a cou­ple of hours, go to Gringotts the mo­ment it opened, then set off – where, he didn’t know.

Ern slammed on the brakes and the Knight Bus skid­ded to a halt in front of a small and shab­by-​look­ing pub, the Leaky Caul­dron, be­hind which lay the mag­ical en­trance to Di­agon Al­ley.

‘Thanks,’ Har­ry said to Ern.

He jumped down the steps and helped Stan low­er his trunk and Hed­wig’s cage on­to the pave­ment.

‘Well,’ said Har­ry, ‘bye then!’

But Stan wasn’t pay­ing at­ten­tion. Still stand­ing in the door­way to the bus, he was gog­gling at the shad­owy en­trance to the Leaky Caul­dron.

‘There you are, Har­ry’ said a voice.

Be­fore Har­ry could turn, he felt a hand on his shoul­der. At the same time, Stan shout­ed, ‘Blimey! Ern, come ’ere! Come ’ere!’

Har­ry looked up at the own­er of the hand on his shoul­der and felt a buck­et­ful of ice cas­cade in­to his stom­ach – he had walked right in­to Cor­nelius Fudge, the Min­is­ter for Mag­ic him­self.

Stan leapt on­to the pave­ment be­side them.

‘What did­ja call Neville, Min­is­ter?’ he said ex­cit­ed­ly.

Fudge, a port­ly lit­tle man in a long, pin­striped cloak, looked cold and ex­haust­ed.

‘Neville?’ he re­peat­ed, frown­ing. ‘This is Har­ry Pot­ter.’

‘I knew it!’ Stan shout­ed glee­ful­ly. ‘Ern! Ern! Guess ’oo Neville is, Ern! ’E’s ’Ar­ry Pot­ter! I can see ’is scar!’

‘Yes,’ said Fudge testi­ly. ‘Well, I’m very glad the Knight Bus picked Har­ry up, but he and I need to step in­side the Leaky Caul­dron now …’

Fudge in­creased the pres­sure on Har­ry’s shoul­der, and Har­ry found him­self be­ing steered in­side the pub. A stoop­ing fig­ure bear­ing a lantern ap­peared through the door be­hind the bar. It was Tom, the wiz­ened, tooth­less land­lord.

‘You’ve got him, Min­is­ter!’ said Tom. ‘Will you be want­ing any­thing? Beer? Brandy?’

‘Per­haps a pot of tea,’ said Fudge, who still hadn’t let go of Har­ry.

There was a loud scrap­ing and puff­ing from be­hind them, and Stan and Ern ap­peared, car­ry­ing Har­ry’s trunk and Hed­wig’s cage and look­ing around ex­cit­ed­ly.

‘’Ow come you di’n’t tell us ’oo you are, eh, Neville?’ said Stan, beam­ing at Har­ry, while Ernie’s owlish face peered in­ter­est­ed­ly over Stan’s shoul­der.

‘And a pri­vate par­lour, please, Tom,’ said Fudge point­ed­ly.

‘Bye,’ Har­ry said mis­er­ably to Stan and Ern, as Tom beck­oned Fudge to­wards the pas­sage that led from the bar.

‘Bye, Neville!’ called Stan.

Fudge marched Har­ry along the nar­row pas­sage af­ter Tom’s lantern, and then in­to a small par­lour. Tom clicked his fin­gers, a fire burst in­to life in the grate, and he bowed him­self out of the room.

‘Sit down, Har­ry,’ said Fudge, in­di­cat­ing a chair by the fire.

Har­ry sat down, feel­ing goose­bumps ris­ing up his arms de­spite the glow of the fire. Fudge took off his pin­striped cloak and tossed it aside, then hitched up the trousers of his bot­tle-​green suit and sat down op­po­site Har­ry.

‘I am Cor­nelius Fudge, Har­ry. The Min­is­ter for Mag­ic.’

Har­ry al­ready knew this, of course; he had seen Fudge once be­fore, but as he had been wear­ing his fa­ther’s In­vis­ibil­ity Cloak at the time, Fudge wasn’t to know that.

Tom the innkeep­er reap­peared, wear­ing an apron over his night­shirt and bear­ing a tray of tea and crum­pets. He placed the tray on a ta­ble be­tween Fudge and Har­ry, and left the par­lour, clos­ing the door be­hind him.

‘Well, Har­ry,’ said Fudge, pour­ing out tea, ‘you’ve had us all in a right flap, I don’t mind telling you. Run­ning away from your aunt and un­cle’s house like that! I’d start­ed to think … but you’re safe, and that’s what mat­ters.’

Fudge but­tered him­self a crum­pet and pushed the plate to­wards Har­ry.

‘Eat, Har­ry, you look dead on your feet. Now then … You will be pleased to hear that we have dealt with the un­for­tu­nate blow­ing-​up of Miss Mar­jorie Durs­ley. Two mem­bers of the Ac­ci­den­tal Mag­ic Re­ver­sal De­part­ment were dis­patched to Priv­et Drive a few hours ago. Miss Durs­ley has been punc­tured and her mem­ory has been mod­ified. She has no rec­ol­lec­tion of the in­ci­dent at all. So that’s that, and no harm done.’

Fudge smiled at Har­ry over the rim of his teacup, rather like an un­cle sur­vey­ing a favourite nephew. Har­ry, who couldn’t be­lieve his ears, opened his mouth to speak, couldn’t think of any­thing to say, and closed it again.

‘Ah, you’re wor­ry­ing about the re­ac­tion of your aunt and un­cle?’ said Fudge. ‘Well, I won’t de­ny that they are ex­treme­ly an­gry, Har­ry, but they are pre­pared to take you back next sum­mer as long as you stay at Hog­warts for the Christ­mas and East­er hol­idays.’

Har­ry un­stuck his throat.

‘I al­ways stay at Hog­warts for the Christ­mas and East­er hol­idays,’ he said, ‘and I don’t ev­er want to go back to Priv­et Drive.’

‘Now, now, I’m sure you’ll feel dif­fer­ent­ly once you’ve calmed down,’ said Fudge in a wor­ried tone. ‘They are your fam­ily, af­ter all, and I’m sure you are fond of each oth­er – er – very deep down.’

It didn’t oc­cur to Har­ry to put Fudge right. He was still wait­ing to hear what was go­ing to hap­pen to him now.

‘So all that re­mains,’ said Fudge, now but­ter­ing him­self a sec­ond crum­pet, ‘is to de­cide where you’re go­ing to spend the last two weeks of your hol­idays. I sug­gest you take a room here at the Leaky Caul­dron and –’

‘Hang on,’ blurt­ed Har­ry, ‘what about my pun­ish­ment?’

Fudge blinked.

‘Pun­ish­ment?’

‘I broke the law!’ Har­ry said. ‘The De­cree for the Re­stric­tion of Un­der­age Wiz­ardry!’

‘Oh, my dear boy, we’re not go­ing to pun­ish you for a lit­tle thing like that!’ cried Fudge, wav­ing his crum­pet im­pa­tient­ly. ‘It was an ac­ci­dent! We don’t send peo­ple to Azk­aban just for blow­ing up their aunts!’

But this didn’t tal­ly at all with Har­ry’s past deal­ings with the Min­istry of Mag­ic.

‘Last year, I got an of­fi­cial warn­ing just be­cause a house-​elf smashed a pud­ding in my un­cle’s house!’ said Har­ry, frown­ing. ‘The Min­istry of Mag­ic said I’d be ex­pelled from Hog­warts if there was any more mag­ic there!’

Un­less Har­ry’s eyes were de­ceiv­ing him, Fudge was sud­den­ly look­ing awk­ward.

‘Cir­cum­stances change, Har­ry … we have to take in­to ac­count … in the present cli­mate … sure­ly you don’t want to be ex­pelled?’

‘Of course I don’t,’ said Har­ry.

‘Well then, what’s all the fuss about?’ laughed Fudge air­ily. ‘Now, have a crum­pet, Har­ry, while I go and see if Tom’s got a room for you.’

Fudge strode out of the par­lour and Har­ry stared af­ter him. There was some­thing ex­treme­ly odd go­ing on. Why had Fudge been wait­ing for him at the Leaky Caul­dron, if not to pun­ish him for what he’d done. And now Har­ry came to think of it, sure­ly it wasn’t usu­al for the Min­is­ter for Mag­ic him­self to get in­volved in mat­ters of un­der­age mag­ic?

Fudge came back, ac­com­pa­nied by Tom the innkeep­er.

‘Room eleven’s free, Har­ry,’ said Fudge. ‘I think you’ll be very com­fort­able. Just one thing, and I’m sure you’ll un­der­stand: I don’t want you wan­der­ing off in­to Mug­gle Lon­don, all right? Keep to Di­agon Al­ley. And you’re to be back here be­fore dark each night. Sure you’ll un­der­stand. Tom will be keep­ing an eye on you for me.’

‘OK,’ said Har­ry slow­ly, ‘but why –?’

‘Don’t want to lose you again, do we?’ said Fudge with a hearty laugh. ‘No, no … best we know where you are … I mean …’

Fudge cleared his throat loud­ly and picked up his pin­striped cloak.

‘Well, I’ll be off, plen­ty to do, you know.’

‘Have you had any luck with Black yet?’ Har­ry asked.

Fudge’s fin­gers slipped on the sil­ver fas­ten­ings of his cloak.

‘What’s that? Oh, you’ve heard – well, no, not yet, but it’s on­ly a mat­ter of time. The Azk­aban guards have nev­er yet failed … and they are an­gri­er than I’ve ev­er seen them.’

Fudge shud­dered slight­ly.

‘So, I’ll say good­bye.’

He held out his hand and Har­ry, shak­ing it, had a sud­den idea.

‘Er – Min­is­ter? Can I ask you some­thing?’

‘Cer­tain­ly’ smiled Fudge.

‘Well, third years at Hog­warts are al­lowed to vis­it Hogsmeade, but my aunt and un­cle didn’t sign the per­mis­sion form. D’you think you could?’

Fudge was look­ing un­com­fort­able.

‘Ah,’ he said. ‘No. No, I’m very sor­ry, Har­ry, but as I’m not your par­ent or guardian –’

‘But you’re the Min­is­ter for Mag­ic,’ said Har­ry ea­ger­ly. ‘If you gave me per­mis­sion –’

‘No, I’m sor­ry, Har­ry, but rules are rules,’ said Fudge flat­ly. ‘Per­haps you’ll be able to vis­it Hogsmeade next year. In fact, I think it best if you don’t … yes … well, I’ll be off. En­joy your stay, Har­ry.’

And with a last smile and shake of Har­ry’s hand, Fudge left the room. Tom now moved for­ward, beam­ing at Har­ry.

‘If you’ll fol­low me, Mr Pot­ter,’ he said. ‘I’ve al­ready tak­en your things up …’

Har­ry fol­lowed Tom up a hand­some wood­en stair­case to a door with a brass num­ber eleven on it, which Tom un­locked and opened for him.

In­side was a very com­fort­able-​look­ing bed, some high­ly pol­ished oak fur­ni­ture, a cheer­ful­ly crack­ling fire and, perched on top of the wardrobe –

‘Hed­wig!’ Har­ry gasped.

The snowy owl clicked her break and flut­tered down on­to Har­ry’s arm.

‘Very smart owl you’ve got there,’ chuck­led Tom. ‘Ar­rived about five min­utes af­ter you did. If there’s any­thing you need, Mr Pot­ter, don’t hes­itate to ask.’

He gave an­oth­er bow and left.

Har­ry sat on his bed for a long time, ab­sent-​mind­ed­ly stroking Hed­wig. The sky out­side the win­dow was chang­ing rapid­ly from deep, vel­vety blue to cold, steely grey and then, slow­ly, to pink shot with gold. Har­ry could hard­ly be­lieve that he’d on­ly left Priv­et Drive a few hours ago, that he wasn’t ex­pelled, and that he was now fac­ing two com­plete­ly Durs­ley-​free weeks.

‘It’s been a very weird night, Hed­wig,’ he yawned.

And with­out even re­mov­ing his glass­es, he slumped back on­to his pil­lows and fell asleep.
