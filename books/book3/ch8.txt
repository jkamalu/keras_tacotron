CHAPTER EIGHT


Flight of the Fat La­dy



In no time at all, De­fence Against the Dark Arts had be­come most peo­ple’s favourite class. On­ly Dra­co Mal­foy and his gang of Slytherins had any­thing bad to say about Pro­fes­sor Lupin.

‘Look at the state of his robes,’ Mal­foy would say in a loud whis­per as Pro­fes­sor Lupin passed. ‘He dress­es like our old house-​elf.’

But no one else cared that Pro­fes­sor Lupin’s robes were patched and frayed. His next few lessons were just as in­ter­est­ing as the first. Af­ter Bog­garts, they stud­ied Red Caps, nasty lit­tle gob­lin-​like crea­tures that lurked wher­ev­er there had been blood­shed, in the dun­geons of cas­tles and the pot­holes of de­sert­ed bat­tle­fields, wait­ing to blud­geon those who had got lost. From Red Caps they moved on to Kap­pas, creepy wa­ter-​dwellers that looked like scaly mon­keys, with webbed hands itch­ing to stran­gle un­wit­ting waders in their ponds.

Har­ry on­ly wished he was as hap­py with some of his oth­er class­es. Worst of all was Po­tions. Snape was in a par­tic­ular­ly vin­dic­tive mood these days, and no one was in any doubt why. The sto­ry of the Bog­gart as­sum­ing Snape’s shape, and the way that Neville had dressed it in his grand­moth­er’s clothes, had trav­elled through the school like wild­fire. Snape didn’t seem to find it fun­ny. His eyes flashed men­ac­ing­ly at the very men­tion of Pro­fes­sor Lupin’s name, and he was bul­ly­ing Neville worse than ev­er.

Har­ry was al­so grow­ing to dread the hours he spent in Pro­fes­sor Trelawney’s sti­fling tow­er room, de­ci­pher­ing lop-​sid­ed shapes and sym­bols, try­ing to ig­nore the way Pro­fes­sor Trelawney’s enor­mous eyes filled with tears ev­ery time she looked at him. He couldn’t like Pro­fes­sor Trelawney, even though she was treat­ed with re­spect bor­der­ing on rev­er­ence by many of the class. Par­vati Patil and Laven­der Brown had tak­en to haunt­ing Pro­fes­sor Trelawney’s tow­er room at lunchtimes, and al­ways re­turned with an­noy­ing­ly su­pe­ri­or looks on their faces, as though they knew things the oth­ers didn’t. They had al­so start­ed us­ing hushed voic­es when­ev­er they spoke to Har­ry, as though he was on his deathbed.

No­body re­al­ly liked Care of Mag­ical Crea­tures, which, af­ter the ac­tion-​packed first class, had be­come ex­treme­ly dull. Ha­grid seemed to have lost his con­fi­dence. They were now spend­ing les­son af­ter les­son learn­ing how to look af­ter Flob­ber­worms, which had to be some of the most bor­ing crea­tures in ex­is­tence.

‘Why would any­one both­er look­ing af­ter them?’ said Ron, af­ter yet an­oth­er hour of pok­ing shred­ded let­tuce down the Flob­ber­worms’ slimy throats.

At the start of Oc­to­ber, how­ev­er, Har­ry had some­thing else to oc­cu­py him, some­thing so en­joy­able it made up for his un­sat­is­fac­to­ry class­es. The Quid­ditch sea­son was ap­proach­ing, and Oliv­er Wood, Cap­tain of the Gryffind­or team, called a meet­ing one Thurs­day evening to dis­cuss tac­tics for the new sea­son.

There were sev­en peo­ple on a Quid­ditch team: three Chasers, whose job it was to score goals by putting the Quaf­fle (a red, foot­ball-​sized ball) through one of the fifty-​foot-​high hoops at each end of the pitch; two Beat­ers, who were equipped with heavy bats to re­pel the Bludgers (two heavy black balls which zoomed around try­ing to at­tack the play­ers); a Keep­er, who de­fend­ed the goal­posts, and the Seek­er, who had the hard­est job of all, that of catch­ing the Gold­en Snitch, a tiny, winged, wal­nut-​sized ball, whose cap­ture end­ed the game and earned the Seek­er’s team an ex­tra one hun­dred and fifty points.

Oliv­er Wood was a burly sev­en­teen-​year-​old, now in his sev­enth and fi­nal year at Hog­warts. There was a qui­et sort of des­per­ation in his voice as he ad­dressed his six fel­low team mem­bers in the chilly chang­ing rooms on the edge of the dark­en­ing Quid­ditch pitch.

‘This is our last chance – my last chance – to win the Quid­ditch cup,’ he told them, strid­ing up and down in front of them. ‘I’ll be leav­ing at the end of this year. I’ll nev­er get an­oth­er shot at it.

‘Gryffind­or haven’t won for sev­en years now. OK, so we’ve had the worst luck in the world – in­juries – then the tour­na­ment get­ting called off last year …’ Wood swal­lowed, as though the mem­ory still brought a lump to his throat. ‘But we al­so know we’ve got the best – rud­dy – team – in – the – school,’ he said, punch­ing a fist in­to his oth­er hand, the old man­ic glint back in his eye.

‘We’ve got three su­perb Chasers.’

Wood point­ed at Ali­cia Spin­net, An­geli­na John­son and Katie Bell.

‘We’ve got two un­beat­able Beat­ers.’

‘Stop it, Oliv­er, you’re em­bar­rass­ing us,’ said Fred and George Weasley to­geth­er, pre­tend­ing to blush.

‘And we’ve got a Seek­er who has nev­er failed to win us a match!’ Wood rum­bled, glar­ing at Har­ry with a kind of fu­ri­ous pride. ‘And me,’ he added, as an af­terthought.

‘We think you’re very good, too, Oliv­er,’ said George.

‘Crack­ing Keep­er,’ said Fred.

‘The point is,’ Wood went on, re­sum­ing his pac­ing, ‘the Quid­ditch cup should have had our name on it these last two years. Ev­er since Har­ry joined the team, I’ve thought the thing was in the bag. But we haven’t got it, and this year’s the last chance we’ll get to fi­nal­ly see our name on the thing …’

Wood spoke so de­ject­ed­ly that even Fred and George looked sym­pa­thet­ic.

‘Oliv­er, this year’s our year,’ said Fred.

‘We’ll do it, Oliv­er!’ said An­geli­na.

‘Def­inite­ly,’ said Har­ry.

Full of de­ter­mi­na­tion, the team start­ed train­ing ses­sions, three evenings a week. The weath­er was get­ting cold­er and wet­ter, the nights dark­er, but no amount of mud, wind or rain could tar­nish Har­ry’s won­der­ful vi­sion of fi­nal­ly win­ning the huge, sil­ver Quid­ditch cup.

Har­ry re­turned to the Gryffind­or com­mon room one evening af­ter train­ing, cold and stiff but pleased with the way prac­tice had gone, to find the room buzzing ex­cit­ed­ly.

‘What’s hap­pened?’ he asked Ron and Hermione, who were sit­ting in two of the best chairs by the fire­side and com­plet­ing some star charts for As­tron­omy.

‘First Hogsmeade week­end,’ said Ron, point­ing at a no­tice that had ap­peared on the bat­tered old no­tice board. ‘End of Oc­to­ber. Hal­lowe’en.’

‘Ex­cel­lent,’ said Fred, who had fol­lowed Har­ry through the por­trait hole. ‘I need to vis­it Zonko’s, I’m near­ly out of Stink Pel­lets.’

Har­ry threw him­self in­to a chair be­side Ron, his high spir­its ebbing away. Hermione seemed to read his mind.

‘Har­ry, I’m sure you’ll be able to go next time,’ she said. ‘They’re bound to catch Black soon, he’s been sight­ed once al­ready.’

‘Black’s not fool enough to try any­thing in Hogsmeade,’ said Ron. ‘Ask McG­ona­gall if you can go this time, Har­ry, the next one might not be for ages –’

‘Ron!’ said Hermione. ‘Har­ry’s sup­posed to stay in school –’

‘He can’t be the on­ly third-​year left be­hind,’ said Ron. ‘Ask McG­ona­gall, go on, Har­ry –’

‘Yeah, I think I will,’ said Har­ry, mak­ing up his mind.

Hermione opened her mouth to ar­gue, but at that mo­ment Crook­shanks leapt light­ly on­to her lap. A large, dead spi­der was dan­gling from his mouth.

‘Does he have to eat that in front of us?’ said Ron, scowl­ing.

‘Clever Crook­shanks, did you catch that all by your­self?’ said Hermione.

Crook­shanks slow­ly chewed up the spi­der, his yel­low eyes fixed in­so­lent­ly on Ron.

‘Just keep him over there, that’s all,’ said Ron ir­ri­ta­bly, turn­ing back to his star chart. ‘I’ve got Scab­bers asleep in my bag.’

Har­ry yawned. He re­al­ly want­ed to go to bed, but he still had his own star chart to com­plete. He pulled his bag to­wards him, took out parch­ment, ink and quill, and start­ed work.

‘You can copy mine, if you like,’ said Ron, la­belling his last star with a flour­ish and shov­ing the chart to­wards Har­ry.

Hermione, who dis­ap­proved of copy­ing, pursed her lips, but didn’t say any­thing. Crook­shanks was still star­ing un­blink­ing­ly at Ron, flick­ing the end of his bushy tail. Then, with­out warn­ing, he pounced.

‘OY!’ Ron roared, seiz­ing his bag, as Crook­shanks sank four sets of claws deeply in­to it, and be­gan tear­ing fe­ro­cious­ly. ‘GET OFF, YOU STUPID AN­IMAL!’

Ron tried to pull the bag away from Crook­shanks, but Crook­shanks clung on, spit­ting and slash­ing.

‘Ron, don’t hurt him!’ squealed Hermione. The whole com­mon room was watch­ing; Ron whirled the bag around, Crook­shanks still cling­ing to it, and Scab­bers came fly­ing out of the top –

‘CATCH THAT CAT!’ Ron yelled, as Crook­shanks freed him­self from the rem­nants of the bag, sprang over the ta­ble and chased af­ter the ter­ri­fied Scab­bers.

George Weasley made a lunge for Crook­shanks but missed; Scab­bers streaked through twen­ty pairs of legs and shot be­neath an old chest of draw­ers. Crook­shanks skid­ded to a halt, crouched low on his bandy legs and start­ed mak­ing fu­ri­ous swipes be­neath the chest of draw­ers with his front paw.

Ron and Hermione hur­ried over; Hermione grabbed Crook­shanks around the mid­dle and heaved him away; Ron threw him­self on­to his stom­ach and, with great dif­fi­cul­ty, pulled Scab­bers out by the tail.

‘Look at him!’ he said fu­ri­ous­ly to Hermione, dan­gling Scab­bers in front of her. ‘He’s skin and bone! You keep that cat away from him!’

‘Crook­shanks doesn’t un­der­stand it’s wrong!’ said Hermione, her voice shak­ing. ‘All cats chase rats, Ron!’

‘There’s some­thing fun­ny about that an­imal!’ said Ron, who was try­ing to per­suade a fran­ti­cal­ly wig­gling Scab­bers back in­to his pock­et. ‘It heard me say that Scab­bers was in my bag!’

‘Oh, what rub­bish,’ said Hermione im­pa­tient­ly. ‘Crook­shanks could smell him, Ron, how else d’you think –’

‘That cat’s got it in for Scab­bers!’ said Ron, ig­nor­ing the peo­ple around him, who were start­ing to gig­gle. ‘And Scab­bers was here first, and he’s ill!’

Ron marched through the com­mon room and out of sight up the stairs to the boys’ dor­mi­to­ries.

*

Ron was still in a bad mood with Hermione next day. He bare­ly talked to her all through Her­bol­ogy, even though he, Har­ry and Hermione were work­ing to­geth­er on the same Puffa­pod.

‘How’s Scab­bers?’ Hermione asked timid­ly, as they stripped fat pink pods from the plants and emp­tied the shin­ing beans in­to a wood­en pail.

‘He’s hid­ing at the bot­tom of my bed, shak­ing,’ said Ron an­gri­ly, miss­ing the pail and scat­ter­ing beans over the green­house floor.

‘Care­ful, Weasley, care­ful!’ cried Pro­fes­sor Sprout, as the beans burst in­to bloom be­fore their very eyes.

They had Trans­fig­ura­tion next. Har­ry, who had re­solved to ask Pro­fes­sor McG­ona­gall af­ter the les­son whether he could go in­to Hogsmeade with the rest, joined the queue out­side the class­room, try­ing to de­cide how he was go­ing to ar­gue his case. He was dis­tract­ed, how­ev­er, by a dis­tur­bance at the front of the line.

Laven­der Brown seemed to be cry­ing. Par­vati had her arm around her, and was ex­plain­ing some­thing to Sea­mus Finni­gan and Dean Thomas, who were look­ing very se­ri­ous.

‘What’s the mat­ter, Laven­der?’ said Hermione anx­ious­ly, as she, Har­ry and Ron went to join the group.

‘She got a let­ter from home this morn­ing,’ Par­vati whis­pered. ‘It’s her rab­bit, Binky. He’s been killed by a fox.’

‘Oh,’ said Hermione. ‘I’m sor­ry, Laven­der.’

‘I should have known!’ said Laven­der trag­ical­ly. ‘You know what day it is?’

‘Er–’

‘The six­teenth of Oc­to­ber! ‘That thing you’re dread­ing, it will hap­pen on the six­teenth of Oc­to­ber!’ Re­mem­ber? She was right, she was right!’

The whole class was gath­ered around Laven­der now. Sea­mus shook his head se­ri­ous­ly. Hermione hes­itat­ed; then she said, ‘You – you were dread­ing Binky be­ing killed by a fox?’

‘Well, not nec­es­sar­ily by a fox,’ said Laven­der, look­ing up at Hermione with stream­ing eyes, ‘but I was ob­vi­ous­ly dread­ing him dy­ing, wasn’t I?’

‘Oh,’ said Hermione. She paused again. Then –

‘Was Binky an old rab­bit?’

‘N-​no!’ sobbed Laven­der. ‘H-​he was on­ly a ba­by!’

Par­vati tight­ened her arm around Laven­der’s shoul­ders.

‘But then, why would you dread him dy­ing?’ said Hermione.

Par­vati glared at her.

‘Well, look at it log­ical­ly,’ said Hermione, turn­ing to the rest of the group. ‘I mean, Binky didn’t even die to­day, did he, Laven­der just got the news to­day –’ Laven­der wailed loud­ly ‘– and she can’t have been dread­ing it, be­cause it’s come as a re­al shock –’

‘Don’t mind Hermione, Laven­der,’ said Ron loud­ly, ‘she doesn’t think oth­er peo­ple’s pets mat­ter very much.’

Pro­fes­sor McG­ona­gall opened the class­room door at that mo­ment, which was per­haps lucky; Hermione and Ron were look­ing dag­gers at each oth­er, and when they got in­to class, they seat­ed them­selves ei­ther side of Har­ry, and didn’t talk to each oth­er all les­son.

Har­ry still hadn’t de­cid­ed what he was go­ing to say to Pro­fes­sor McG­ona­gall when the bell rang at the end of the les­son, but it was she who brought up the sub­ject of Hogsmeade first.

‘One mo­ment, please!’ she called, as the class made to leave. ‘As you’re all in my house, you should hand Hogsmeade per­mis­sion forms to me be­fore Hal­lowe’en. No form, no vis­it­ing the vil­lage, so don’t for­get!’

Neville put up his hand.

‘Please, Pro­fes­sor, I – I think I’ve lost –’

‘Your grand­moth­er sent yours to me di­rect­ly, Long­bot­tom,’ said Pro­fes­sor McG­ona­gall. ‘She seemed to think it was safer. Well, that’s all, you may leave.’

‘Ask her now,’ Ron hissed at Har­ry.

‘Oh, but –’ Hermione be­gan.

‘Go for it, Har­ry’ said Ron stub­born­ly.

Har­ry wait­ed for the rest of the class to dis­ap­pear, then head­ed ner­vous­ly for Pro­fes­sor McG­ona­gall’s desk.

‘Yes, Pot­ter?’

Har­ry took a deep breath.

‘Pro­fes­sor, my aunt and un­cle – er – for­got to sign my form,’ he said.

Pro­fes­sor McG­ona­gall looked over her square spec­ta­cles at him, but didn’t say any­thing.

‘So – er – d’you think it would be all right – I mean, will it be OK if I – if I go to Hogsmeade?’

Pro­fes­sor McG­ona­gall looked down and be­gan shuf­fling pa­pers on her desk.

‘I’m afraid not, Pot­ter,’ she said. ‘You heard what I said. No form, no vis­it­ing the vil­lage. That’s the rule.’

‘But – Pro­fes­sor, my aunt and un­cle – you know, they’re Mug­gles, they don’t re­al­ly un­der­stand about – about Hog­warts forms and stuff,’ Har­ry said, while Ron egged him on with vig­or­ous nods. ‘If you said I could go –’

‘But I don’t say so,’ said Pro­fes­sor McG­ona­gall, stand­ing up and pil­ing her pa­pers neat­ly in­to a draw­er. ‘The form clear­ly states that the par­ent or guardian must give per­mis­sion.’ She turned to look at him, with an odd ex­pres­sion on her face. Was it pity? ‘I’m sor­ry, Pot­ter, but that’s my fi­nal word. You had bet­ter hur­ry, or you’ll be late for your next les­son.’

*

There was noth­ing to be done. Ron called Pro­fes­sor McG­ona­gall a lot of names that great­ly an­noyed Hermione; Hermione as­sumed an ‘all-​for-​the-​best’ ex­pres­sion that made Ron even an­gri­er, and Har­ry had to en­dure ev­ery­one in the class talk­ing loud­ly and hap­pi­ly about what they were go­ing to do first, once they got in­to Hogsmeade.

‘There’s al­ways the feast,’ said Ron, in an ef­fort to cheer Har­ry up. ‘You know, the Hal­lowe’en feast, in the evening.’

‘Yeah,’ said Har­ry, gloomi­ly, ‘great.’

The Hal­lowe’en feast was al­ways good, but it would taste a lot bet­ter if he was com­ing to it af­ter a day in Hogsmeade with ev­ery­one else. Noth­ing any­one said made him feel any bet­ter about be­ing left be­hind. Dean Thomas, who was good with a quill, had of­fered to forge Un­cle Ver­non’s sig­na­ture on the form, but as Har­ry had al­ready told Pro­fes­sor McG­ona­gall he hadn’t had it signed, that was no good. Ron half-​heart­ed­ly sug­gest­ed the In­vis­ibil­ity Cloak, but Hermione stamped on that one, re­mind­ing Ron what Dum­ble­dore had told them about the De­men­tors be­ing able to see through them. Per­cy had what were pos­si­bly the least help­ful words of com­fort.

‘They make a fuss about Hogsmeade, but I as­sure you, Har­ry, it’s not all it’s cracked up to be,’ he said se­ri­ous­ly. ‘All right, the sweet­shop’s rather good, but Zonko’s Joke Shop’s frankly dan­ger­ous, and yes, the Shriek­ing Shack’s al­ways worth a vis­it, but re­al­ly, Har­ry, apart from that, you’re not miss­ing any­thing.’

*

On Hal­lowe’en morn­ing, Har­ry awoke with the rest and went down to break­fast feel­ing thor­ough­ly de­pressed, though do­ing his best to act nor­mal­ly.

‘We’ll bring you lots of sweets back from Hon­ey­dukes,’ said Hermione, look­ing des­per­ate­ly sor­ry for him.

‘Yeah, loads,’ said Ron. He and Hermione had fi­nal­ly for­got­ten their squab­ble about Crook­shanks in the face of Har­ry’s dis­ap­point­ment.

‘Don’t wor­ry about me,’ said Har­ry, in what he hoped was an off­hand voice. ‘I’ll see you at the feast. Have a good time.’

He ac­com­pa­nied them to the En­trance Hall, where Filch, the care­tak­er, was stand­ing in­side the front doors, check­ing off names against a long list, peer­ing sus­pi­cious­ly in­to ev­ery face, and mak­ing sure that no one was sneak­ing out who shouldn’t be go­ing.

‘Stay­ing here, Pot­ter?’ shout­ed Mal­foy who was stand­ing in line with Crabbe and Goyle. ‘Scared of pass­ing the De­men­tors?’

Har­ry ig­nored him and made his soli­tary way up the mar­ble stair­case, through the de­sert­ed cor­ri­dors, and back to Gryffind­or Tow­er.

‘Pass­word?’ said the Fat La­dy, jerk­ing out of a doze.

‘For­tu­na Ma­jor,’ said Har­ry list­less­ly.

The por­trait swung open and he climbed through the hole in­to the com­mon room. It was full of chat­ter­ing first- and sec­ond-​years, and a few old­er stu­dents who had ob­vi­ous­ly vis­it­ed Hogsmeade so of­ten the nov­el­ty had worn off.

‘Har­ry! Har­ry! Hi, Har­ry!’

It was Col­in Creevey, a sec­ond-​year who was deeply in awe of Har­ry and nev­er missed an op­por­tu­ni­ty to speak to him.

‘Aren’t you go­ing to Hogsmeade, Har­ry? Why not? Hey –’ Col­in looked ea­ger­ly around at his friends, ‘you can come and sit with us, if you like, Har­ry!’

‘Er – no, thanks, Col­in,’ said Har­ry, who wasn’t in the mood to have a lot of peo­ple star­ing avid­ly at the scar on his fore­head. ‘I – I’ve got to go to the li­brary, got to get some work done.’

Af­ter that, he had no choice but to turn right around and head back out of the por­trait hole again.

‘What was the point of wak­ing me up?’ the Fat La­dy called grumpi­ly af­ter him as he walked away.

Har­ry wan­dered dispirit­ed­ly to­wards the li­brary, but halfway there he changed his mind; he didn’t feel like work­ing. He turned around and came face to face with Filch, who had ob­vi­ous­ly just seen off the last of the Hogsmeade vis­itors.

‘What are you do­ing?’ Filch snarled sus­pi­cious­ly.

‘Noth­ing,’ said Har­ry truth­ful­ly.

‘Noth­ing!’ spat Filch, his jowls quiv­er­ing un­pleas­ant­ly. ‘A like­ly sto­ry! Sneak­ing around on your own, why aren’t you in Hogsmeade buy­ing Stink Pel­lets and Belch Pow­der and Whizzing Worms like the rest of your nasty lit­tle friends?’

Har­ry shrugged.

‘Well, get back to your com­mon room where you be­long!’ snapped Filch, and he stood glar­ing un­til Har­ry had passed out of sight.

But Har­ry didn’t go back to the com­mon room; he climbed a stair­case, think­ing vague­ly of vis­it­ing the Owlery to see Hed­wig, and was walk­ing along an­oth­er cor­ri­dor when a voice from in­side one of the rooms said, ‘Har­ry?’

Har­ry dou­bled back to see who had spo­ken and met Pro­fes­sor Lupin, look­ing around his of­fice door.

‘What are you do­ing?’ said Lupin, in a very dif­fer­ent voice from Filch. ‘Where are Ron and Hermione?’

‘Hogsmeade,’ said Har­ry, in a would-​be ca­su­al voice.

‘Ah,’ said Lupin. He con­sid­ered Har­ry for a mo­ment. ‘Why don’t you come in? I’ve just tak­en de­liv­ery of a Grindy­low for our next les­son.’

‘A what?’ said Har­ry.

He fol­lowed Lupin in­to his of­fice. In the cor­ner stood a very large tank of wa­ter. A sick­ly green crea­ture with sharp lit­tle horns had its face pressed against the glass, pulling faces and flex­ing its long, spindly fin­gers.

‘Wa­ter de­mon,’ said Lupin, sur­vey­ing the Grindy­low thought­ful­ly. ‘We shouldn’t have much dif­fi­cul­ty with him, not af­ter the Kap­pas. The trick is to break his grip. You no­tice the ab­nor­mal­ly long fin­gers? Strong, but very brit­tle.’

The Grindy­low bared its green teeth and then buried it­self in a tan­gle of weed in a cor­ner.

‘Cup of tea?’ Lupin said, look­ing around for his ket­tle. ‘I was just think­ing of mak­ing one.’

‘All right,’ said Har­ry awk­ward­ly.

Lupin tapped the ket­tle with his wand and a blast of steam is­sued sud­den­ly from the spout.

‘Sit down,’ said Lupin, tak­ing the lid off a dusty tin. ‘I’ve on­ly got teabags, I’m afraid – but I dare­say you’ve had enough of tea leaves?’

Har­ry looked at him. Lupin’s eyes were twin­kling.

‘How did you know about that?’ Har­ry asked.

‘Pro­fes­sor McG­ona­gall told me,’ said Lupin, pass­ing Har­ry a chipped mug of tea. ‘You’re not wor­ried, are you?’

‘No,’ said Har­ry.

He thought for a mo­ment of telling Lupin about the dog he’d seen in Mag­no­lia Cres­cent, but de­cid­ed not to. He didn’t want Lupin to think he was a cow­ard, es­pe­cial­ly since Lupin al­ready seemed to think he couldn’t cope with a Bog­gart.

Some­thing of Har­ry’s thoughts seemed to have shown on his face, be­cause Lupin said, ‘Any­thing wor­ry­ing you, Har­ry?’

‘No,’ Har­ry lied. He drank a bit of tea and watched the Grindy­low bran­dish­ing a fist at him. ‘Yes,’ he said sud­den­ly, putting his tea down on Lupin’s desk. ‘You know that day we fought the Bog­gart?’

‘Yes,’ said Lupin slow­ly.

‘Why didn’t you let me fight it?’ said Har­ry abrupt­ly.

Lupin raised his eye­brows.

‘I would have thought that was ob­vi­ous, Har­ry,’ he said, sound­ing sur­prised.

Har­ry, who had ex­pect­ed Lupin to de­ny that he’d done any such thing, was tak­en aback.

‘Why?’ he said again.

‘Well,’ said Lupin, frown­ing slight­ly, ‘I as­sumed that if the Bog­gart faced you, it would as­sume the shape of Lord Volde­mort.’

Har­ry stared. Not on­ly was this the last an­swer he’d ex­pect­ed, but Lupin had said Volde­mort’s name. The on­ly per­son Har­ry had ev­er heard say the name aloud (apart from him­self) was Pro­fes­sor Dum­ble­dore.

‘Clear­ly, I was wrong,’ said Lupin, still frown­ing at Har­ry. ‘But I didn’t think it a good idea for Lord Volde­mort to ma­te­ri­alise in the staff room. I imag­ined that peo­ple would pan­ic.’

‘I did think of Volde­mort first,’ said Har­ry hon­est­ly. ‘But then I – I re­mem­bered those De­men­tors.’

‘I see,’ said Lupin thought­ful­ly. ‘Well, well … I’m im­pressed.’ He smiled slight­ly at the look of sur­prise on Har­ry’s face. ‘That sug­gests that what you fear most of all is – fear. Very wise, Har­ry.’

Har­ry didn’t know what to say to that, so he drank some more tea.

‘So you’ve been think­ing that I didn’t be­lieve you ca­pa­ble of fight­ing the Bog­gart?’ said Lupin shrewd­ly.

‘Well … yeah,’ said Har­ry. He was sud­den­ly feel­ing a lot hap­pi­er. ‘Pro­fes­sor Lupin, you know the De­men­tors –’

He was in­ter­rupt­ed by a knock on the door.

‘Come in,’ called Lupin.

The door opened, and in came Snape. He was car­ry­ing a gob­let, which was smok­ing faint­ly, and stopped at the sight of Har­ry, his black eyes nar­row­ing.

‘Ah, Severus,’ said Lupin, smil­ing. ‘Thanks very much. Could you leave it here on the desk for me?’

Snape set the smok­ing gob­let down, his eyes wan­der­ing be­tween Har­ry and Lupin.

‘I was just show­ing Har­ry my Grindy­low,’ said Lupin pleas­ant­ly, point­ing at the tank.

‘Fas­ci­nat­ing,’ said Snape, with­out look­ing at it. ‘You should drink that di­rect­ly, Lupin.’

‘Yes, yes, I will,’ said Lupin.

‘I made an en­tire caul­dron­ful,’ Snape con­tin­ued. ‘If you need more.’

‘I should prob­ably take some again to­mor­row. Thanks very much, Severus.’

‘Not at all,’ said Snape, but there was a look in his eye Har­ry didn’t like. He backed out of the room, un­smil­ing and watch­ful.

Har­ry looked cu­ri­ous­ly at the gob­let. Lupin smiled.

‘Pro­fes­sor Snape has very kind­ly con­coct­ed a po­tion for me,’ he said. ‘I have nev­er been much of a po­tion-​brew­er and this one is par­tic­ular­ly com­plex.’ He picked up the gob­let and sniffed it. ‘Pity sug­ar makes it use­less,’ he added, tak­ing a sip and shud­der­ing.

‘Why –?’ Har­ry be­gan. Lupin looked at him and an­swered the un­fin­ished ques­tion.

‘I’ve been feel­ing a bit off-​colour,’ he said. ‘This po­tion is the on­ly thing that helps. I am very lucky to be work­ing along­side Pro­fes­sor Snape; there aren’t many wiz­ards who are up to mak­ing it.’

Pro­fes­sor Lupin took an­oth­er sip and Har­ry had a mad urge to knock the gob­let out of his hands.

‘Pro­fes­sor Snape’s very in­ter­est­ed in the Dark Arts,’ he blurt­ed out.

‘Re­al­ly?’ said Lupin, look­ing on­ly mild­ly in­ter­est­ed as he took an­oth­er gulp of po­tion.

‘Some peo­ple reck­on –’ Har­ry hes­itat­ed, then plunged reck­less­ly on, ‘some peo­ple reck­on he’d do any­thing to get the De­fence Against the Dark Arts job.’

Lupin drained the gob­let and pulled a face.

‘Dis­gust­ing,’ he said. ‘Well, Har­ry, I’d bet­ter get back to work. I’ll see you at the feast lat­er.’

‘Right,’ said Har­ry, putting his emp­ty teacup down.

The emp­ty gob­let was still smok­ing.

*

‘There you go,’ said Ron. ‘We got as much as we could car­ry.’

A show­er of bril­liant­ly coloured sweets fell in­to Har­ry’s lap. It was dusk, and Ron and Hermione had just turned up in the com­mon room, pink-​faced from the cold wind and look­ing as though they’d had the time of their lives.

‘Thanks,’ said Har­ry, pick­ing up a pack­et of tiny black Pep­per Imps. ‘What’s Hogsmeade like? Where did you go?’

By the sound of it – ev­ery­where. Dervish and Banges, the wiz­ard­ing equip­ment shop, Zonko’s Joke Shop, in­to the Three Broom­sticks for foam­ing mugs of hot But­ter­beer and many places be­sides.

‘The post of­fice, Har­ry! About two hun­dred owls, all sit­ting on shelves, all colour-​cod­ed de­pend­ing on how fast you want your let­ter to get there!’

‘Hon­ey­dukes have got a new kind of fudge, they were giv­ing out free sam­ples, there’s a bit, look –’

‘We think we saw an ogre, hon­est­ly, they get all sorts at the Three Broom­sticks –’

‘Wish we could have brought you some But­ter­beer, re­al­ly warms you up –’

‘What did you do?’ said Hermione, look­ing anx­ious. ‘Did you get any work done?’

‘No,’ said Har­ry. ‘Lupin made me a cup of tea in his of­fice. And then Snape came in …’

He told them all about the gob­let. Ron’s mouth fell open.

‘Lupin drank it?’ he gasped. ‘Is he mad?’

Hermione checked her watch.

‘We’d bet­ter go down, you know, the feast’ll be start­ing in five min­utes …’ They hur­ried through the por­trait hole and in­to the crowd, still dis­cussing Snape.

‘But if he – you know –’ Hermione dropped her voice, glanc­ing ner­vous­ly around, ‘if he was try­ing to – to poi­son Lupin – he wouldn’t have done it in front of Har­ry.’

‘Yeah, maybe,’ said Har­ry, as they reached the En­trance Hall and crossed in­to the Great Hall. It had been dec­orat­ed with hun­dreds and hun­dreds of can­dle-​filled pump­kins, a cloud of flut­ter­ing live bats and many flam­ing or­ange stream­ers, which were swim­ming lazi­ly across the stormy ceil­ing like bril­liant wa­ter­snakes.

The food was de­li­cious; even Hermione and Ron, who were full to burst­ing with Hon­ey­dukes sweets man­aged sec­ond help­ings of ev­ery­thing. Har­ry kept glanc­ing at the staff ta­ble. Pro­fes­sor Lupin looked cheer­ful and as well as he ev­er did; he was talk­ing an­imat­ed­ly to tiny lit­tle Pro­fes­sor Flitwick, the Charms teach­er. Har­ry moved his eyes along the ta­ble, to the place where Snape sat. Was he imag­in­ing it, or were Snape’s eyes flick­er­ing to­wards Lupin more of­ten than was nat­ural?

The feast fin­ished with an en­ter­tain­ment pro­vid­ed by the Hog­warts ghosts. They popped out of the walls and ta­bles to do a spot of for­ma­tion glid­ing; Near­ly Head­less Nick, the Gryffind­or ghost, had a great suc­cess with a re-​en­act­ment of his own botched be­head­ing.

It had been such a good evening that Har­ry’s good mood couldn’t even be spoiled by Mal­foy, who shout­ed through the crowd as they all left the Hall, ‘The De­men­tors send their love, Pot­ter!’

Har­ry, Ron and Hermione fol­lowed the rest of the Gryffind­ors along the usu­al path to Gryffind­or Tow­er, but when they reached the cor­ri­dor which end­ed with the por­trait of the Fat La­dy, they found it jammed with stu­dents.

‘Why isn’t any­one go­ing in?’ said Ron cu­ri­ous­ly.

Har­ry peered over the heads in front of him. The por­trait seemed to be closed.

‘Let me through, please,’ came Per­cy’s voice, and he came bustling im­por­tant­ly through the crowd. ‘What’s the hold-​up here? You can’t all have for­got­ten the pass­word – ex­cuse me, I’m Head Boy –’

And then a si­lence fell over the crowd, from the front first, so that a chill seemed to spread down the cor­ri­dor. They heard Per­cy say, in a sud­den­ly sharp voice, ‘Some­body get Pro­fes­sor Dum­ble­dore. Quick.’

Peo­ple’s heads turned; those at the back were stand­ing on tip­toe.

‘What’s go­ing on?’ said Gin­ny, who had just ar­rived.

Next mo­ment, Pro­fes­sor Dum­ble­dore was there, sweep­ing to­wards the por­trait; the Gryffind­ors squeezed to­geth­er to let him through, and Har­ry, Ron and Hermione moved clos­er to see what the trou­ble was.

‘Oh, my –’ Hermione ex­claimed and grabbed Har­ry’s arm.

The Fat La­dy had van­ished from her por­trait, which had been slashed so vi­cious­ly that strips of can­vas lit­tered the floor; great chunks of it had been torn away com­plete­ly.

Dum­ble­dore took one quick look at the ru­ined paint­ing and turned, his eyes som­bre, to see Pro­fes­sors McG­ona­gall, Lupin and Snape hur­ry­ing to­wards him.

‘We need to find her,’ said Dum­ble­dore. ‘Pro­fes­sor McG­ona­gall, please go to Mr Filch at once and tell him to search ev­ery paint­ing in the cas­tle for the Fat La­dy.’

‘You’ll be lucky!’ said a cack­ling voice.

It was Peeves the poltergeist, bob­bing over the crowd and look­ing de­light­ed, as he al­ways did, at the sight of wreck­age or wor­ry.

‘What do you mean, Peeves?’ said Dum­ble­dore calm­ly, and Peeves’s grin fad­ed a lit­tle. He didn’t dare taunt Dum­ble­dore. In­stead he adopt­ed an oily voice that was no bet­ter than his cack­le.

‘Ashamed, Your Head­ship, sir. Doesn’t want to be seen. She’s a hor­ri­ble mess. Saw her run­ning through the land­scape up on the fourth floor, sir, dodg­ing be­tween the trees. Cry­ing some­thing dread­ful,’ he said hap­pi­ly. ‘Poor thing,’ he added, un­con­vinc­ing­ly.

‘Did she say who did it?’ said Dum­ble­dore qui­et­ly.

‘Oh, yes, Pro­fes­sor­head,’ said Peeves, with the air of one cradling a large bomb­shell in his arms. ‘He got very an­gry when she wouldn’t let him in, you see.’ Peeves flipped over, and grinned at Dum­ble­dore from be­tween his own legs. ‘Nasty tem­per he’s got, that Sir­ius Black.’
