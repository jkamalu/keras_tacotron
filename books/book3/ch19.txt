CHAPTER NINETEEN


The Ser­vant of Lord Volde­mort



Hermione screamed. Black leapt to his feet. Har­ry jumped as though he’d re­ceived a huge elec­tric shock.

‘I found this at the base of the Whomp­ing Wil­low,’ said Snape, throw­ing the Cloak aside, care­ful to keep his wand point­ing di­rect­ly at Lupin’s chest. ‘Very use­ful, Pot­ter, I thank you …’

Snape was slight­ly breath­less, but his face was full of sup­pressed tri­umph. ‘You’re won­der­ing, per­haps, how I knew you were here?’ he said, his eyes glit­ter­ing. ‘I’ve just been to your of­fice, Lupin. You for­got to take your Po­tion tonight, so I took a gob­let­ful along. And very lucky I did … lucky for me, I mean. Ly­ing on your desk was a cer­tain map. One glance at it told me all I need­ed to know. I saw you run­ning along this pas­sage­way and out of sight.’

‘Severus –’ Lupin be­gan, but Snape over­rode him.

‘I’ve told the Head­mas­ter again and again that you’ve been help­ing your old friend Black in­to the cas­tle, Lupin, and here’s the proof. Not even I dreamed you would have the nerve to use this old place as your hide­out –’

‘Severus, you’re mak­ing a mis­take,’ said Lupin ur­gent­ly. ‘You haven’t heard ev­ery­thing – I can ex­plain – Sir­ius is not here to kill Har­ry –’

‘Two more for Azk­aban tonight,’ said Snape, his eyes now gleam­ing fa­nat­ical­ly. ‘I shall be in­ter­est­ed to see how Dum­ble­dore takes this … he was quite con­vinced you were harm­less, you know, Lupin … a tame were­wolf …’

‘You fool,’ said Lupin soft­ly. ‘Is a school­boy grudge worth putting an in­no­cent man back in­side Azk­aban?’

BANG! Thin, snake-​like cords burst from the end of Snape’s wand and twist­ed them­selves around Lupin’s mouth, wrists and an­kles; he over-​bal­anced and fell to the floor, un­able to move. With a roar of rage, Black start­ed to­wards Snape, but Snape point­ed his wand straight be­tween Black’s eyes.

‘Give me a rea­son,’ he whis­pered. ‘Give me a rea­son to do it, and I swear I will.’

Black stopped dead. It would have been im­pos­si­ble to say which face showed more ha­tred.

Har­ry stood there, paral­ysed, not know­ing what to do or who to be­lieve. He glanced around at Ron and Hermione. Ron looked just as con­fused as he did, still fight­ing to keep hold of the strug­gling Scab­bers. Hermione, how­ev­er, took an un­cer­tain step to­wards Snape and said, in a very breath­less voice, ‘Pro­fes­sor Snape – it – it wouldn’t hurt to hear what they’ve got to say, w-​would it?’

‘Miss Granger, you are al­ready fac­ing sus­pen­sion from this school,’ Snape spat. ‘You, Pot­ter and Weasley are out of bounds, in the com­pa­ny of a con­vict­ed mur­der­er and a were­wolf. For once in your life, hold your tongue.’

‘But if – if there was a mis­take –’

‘KEEP QUI­ET, YOU STUPID GIRL!’ Snape shout­ed, look­ing sud­den­ly quite de­ranged. ‘DON’T TALK ABOUT WHAT YOU DON’T UN­DER­STAND!’ A few sparks shot out of the end of his wand, which was still point­ing at Black’s face. Hermione fell silent.

‘Vengeance is very sweet,’ Snape breathed at Black. ‘How I hoped I would be the one to catch you …’

‘The joke’s on you again, Severus,’ snarled Black. ‘As long as this boy brings his rat up to the cas­tle –’ he jerked his head at Ron, ‘– I’ll come qui­et­ly …’

‘Up to the cas­tle?’ said Snape silk­ily. ‘I don’t think we need to go that far. All I have to do is call the De­men­tors once we get out of the Wil­low. They’ll be very pleased to see you, Black … pleased enough to give you a lit­tle kiss, I dare­say …’

What lit­tle colour there was in Black’s face left it.

‘You – you’ve got to hear me out,’ he croaked. ‘The rat – look at the rat –’

But there was a mad glint in Snape’s eye that Har­ry had nev­er seen be­fore. He seemed be­yond rea­son.

‘Come on, all of you,’ he said. He clicked his fin­gers, and the ends of the cords that bound Lupin flew to his hands. ‘I’ll drag the were­wolf. Per­haps the De­men­tors will have a kiss for him, too –’

Be­fore he knew what he was do­ing, Har­ry had crossed the room in three strides, and blocked the door.

‘Get out of the way, Pot­ter, you’re in enough trou­ble al­ready,’ snarled Snape. ‘If I hadn’t been here to save your skin –’

‘Pro­fes­sor Lupin could have killed me about a hun­dred times this year,’ Har­ry said. ‘I’ve been alone with him loads of times, hav­ing de­fence lessons against the De­men­tors. If he was help­ing Black, why didn’t he just fin­ish me off then?’

‘Don’t ask me to fath­om the way a were­wolf’s mind works,’ hissed Snape. ‘Get out of the way, Pot­ter.’

‘YOU’RE PA­THET­IC!’ Har­ry yelled. ‘JUST BE­CAUSE THEY MADE A FOOL OF YOU AT SCHOOL YOU WON’T EVEN LIS­TEN –’

‘SI­LENCE! I WILL NOT BE SPO­KEN TO LIKE THAT!’ Snape shrieked, look­ing mad­der than ev­er. ‘Like fa­ther, like son, Pot­ter! I have just saved your neck, you should be thank­ing me on bend­ed knee! You would have been well served if he’d killed you! You’d have died like your fa­ther, too ar­ro­gant to be­lieve you might be mis­tak­en in Black – now get out of the way, or I will make you, GET OUT OF THE WAY, POT­TER!’

Har­ry made up his mind in a split sec­ond. Be­fore Snape could take even one step to­wards him, he had raised his wand.

‘Ex­pel­liar­mus!’ he yelled – ex­cept that his wasn’t the on­ly voice that shout­ed. There was a blast that made the door rat­tle on its hinges; Snape was lift­ed off his feet and slammed in­to the wall, then slid down it to the floor, a trick­le of blood ooz­ing from un­der his hair. He had been knocked out.

Har­ry looked around. Both Ron and Hermione had tried to dis­arm Snape at ex­act­ly the same mo­ment. Snape’s wand soared in a high arc and land­ed on the bed next to Crook­shanks.

‘You shouldn’t have done that,’ said Black, look­ing at Har­ry. ‘You should have left him to me …’

Har­ry avoid­ed Black’s eyes. He wasn’t sure, even now, that he’d done the right thing.

‘We at­tacked a teach­er … we at­tacked a teach­er …’ Hermione whim­pered, star­ing at the life­less Snape with fright­ened eyes. ‘Oh, we’re go­ing to be in so much trou­ble –’

Lupin was strug­gling against his bonds. Black bent down quick­ly and un­tied him. Lupin straight­ened up, rub­bing his arms where the ropes had cut in­to them.

‘Thank you, Har­ry,’ he said.

‘I’m still not say­ing I be­lieve you,’ Har­ry re­tort­ed.

‘Then it’s time we of­fered you some proof,’ said Black. ‘You, boy – give me Pe­ter. Now.’

Ron clutched Scab­bers clos­er to his chest.

‘Come off it,’ he said weak­ly. ‘Are you try­ing to say you broke out of Azk­aban just to get your hands on Scab­bers? I mean …’ he looked up at Har­ry and Hermione for sup­port. ‘OK, say Pet­ti­grew could turn in­to a rat – there are mil­lions of rats – how’s he sup­posed to know which one he’s af­ter if he was locked up in Azk­aban?’

‘You know, Sir­ius, that’s a fair ques­tion,’ said Lupin, turn­ing to Black and frown­ing slight­ly. ‘How did you find out where he was?’

Black put one of his claw-​like hands in­side his robes and took out a crum­pled piece of pa­per, which he smoothed flat, and held out to show the oth­ers.

It was the pho­to­graph of Ron and his fam­ily that had ap­peared in the Dai­ly Prophet the pre­vi­ous sum­mer, and there, on Ron’s shoul­der, was Scab­bers.

‘How did you get this?’ Lupin asked Black, thun­der­struck.

‘Fudge,’ said Black. ‘When he came to in­spect Azk­aban last year, he gave me his pa­per. And there was Pe­ter, on the front page … on this boy’s shoul­der … I knew him at once … how many times had I seen him trans­form? And the cap­tion said the boy would be go­ing back to Hog­warts … to where Har­ry was …’

‘My God,’ said Lupin soft­ly, star­ing from Scab­bers to the pic­ture in the pa­per and back again. ‘His front paw …’

‘What about it?’ said Ron de­fi­ant­ly.

‘He’s got a toe miss­ing,’ said Black.

‘Of course,’ Lupin breathed, ‘so sim­ple … so bril­liant … He cut it off him­self?’

‘Just be­fore he trans­formed,’ said Black. ‘When I cor­nered him, he yelled for the whole street to hear that I’d be­trayed Lily and James. Then, be­fore I could curse him, he blew apart the street with the wand be­hind his back, killed ev­ery­one with­in twen­ty feet of him­self – and sped down in­to the sew­er with the oth­er rats …’

‘Didn’t you ev­er hear, Ron?’ said Lupin. ‘The biggest bit of Pe­ter they found was his fin­ger.’

‘Look, Scab­bers prob­ably had a fight with an­oth­er rat or some­thing! He’s been in my fam­ily for ages, right –’

‘Twelve years, in fact,’ said Lupin. ‘Didn’t you ev­er won­der why he was liv­ing so long?’

‘We – we’ve been tak­ing good care of him!’ said Ron.

‘Not look­ing too good at the mo­ment, though, is he?’ said Lupin. ‘I’d guess he’s been los­ing weight ev­er since he heard Sir­ius was on the loose again …’

‘He’s been scared of that mad cat!’ said Ron, nod­ding to­wards Crook­shanks, who was still purring on the bed.

But that wasn’t right, Har­ry thought sud­den­ly … Scab­bers had been look­ing ill be­fore he met Crook­shanks … ev­er since Ron’s re­turn from Egypt … since the time when Black had es­caped …

‘This cat isn’t mad,’ said Black hoarse­ly. He reached out a bony hand and stroked Crook­shanks’s fluffy head. ‘He’s the most in­tel­li­gent of his kind I’ve ev­er met. He recog­nised Pe­ter for what he was straight away. And when he met me, he knew I was no dog. It was a while be­fore he trust­ed me. Fi­nal­ly, I man­aged to com­mu­ni­cate to him what I was af­ter, and he’s been help­ing me …’

‘What do you mean?’ breathed Hermione.

‘He tried to bring Pe­ter to me, but couldn’t … so he stole the pass­words in­to Gryffind­or Tow­er for me … As I un­der­stand it, he took them from a boy’s bed­side ta­ble …’

Har­ry’s brain seemed to be sag­ging un­der the weight of what he was hear­ing. It was ab­surd … and yet …

‘But Pe­ter got wind of what was go­ing on and ran for it … this cat – Crook­shanks, did you call him? – told me Pe­ter had left blood on the sheets … I sup­pose he bit him­self … well, fak­ing his own death had worked once …’

These words jolt­ed Har­ry to his sens­es.

‘And why did he fake his death?’ he said fu­ri­ous­ly. ‘Be­cause he knew you were about to kill him like you killed my par­ents!’

‘No,’ said Lupin. ‘Har­ry –’

‘And now you’ve come to fin­ish him off!’

‘Yes, I have,’ said Black, with an evil look at Scab­bers.

‘Then I should’ve let Snape take you!’ Har­ry shout­ed.

‘Har­ry,’ said Lupin hur­ried­ly, ‘don’t you see? All this time we’ve thought Sir­ius be­trayed your par­ents, and Pe­ter tracked him down – but it was the oth­er way around, don’t you see? Pe­ter be­trayed your moth­er and fa­ther – Sir­ius tracked Pe­ter down –’

‘THAT’S NOT TRUE!’ Har­ry yelled. ‘HE WAS THEIR SE­CRET-​KEEP­ER! HE SAID SO BE­FORE YOU TURNED UP, HE SAID HE KILLED THEM!’

He was point­ing at Black, who shook his head slow­ly; the sunken eyes were sud­den­ly over-​bright.

‘Har­ry … I as good as killed them,’ he croaked. ‘I per­suad­ed Lily and James to change to Pe­ter at the last mo­ment, per­suad­ed them to use him as Se­cret-​Keep­er in­stead of me … I’m to blame, I know it … the night they died, I’d ar­ranged to check on Pe­ter, make sure he was still safe, but when I ar­rived at his hid­ing place, he’d gone. Yet there was no sign of a strug­gle. It didn’t feel right. I was scared. I set out for your par­ents’ house straight away. And when I saw their house, de­stroyed, and their bod­ies – I re­alised what Pe­ter must have done. What I’d done.’

His voice broke. He turned away.

‘Enough of this,’ said Lupin, and there was a steely note in his voice Har­ry had nev­er heard be­fore. ‘There’s one cer­tain way to prove what re­al­ly hap­pened. Ron, give me that rat.’

‘What are you go­ing to do with him if I give him to you?’ Ron asked Lupin tense­ly.

‘Force him to show him­self,’ said Lupin. ‘If he re­al­ly is a rat, it won’t hurt him.’

Ron hes­itat­ed, then at long last held out Scab­bers and Lupin took him. Scab­bers be­gan to squeak with­out stop­ping, twist­ing and turn­ing, his tiny black eyes bulging in his head.

‘Ready, Sir­ius?’ said Lupin.

Black had al­ready re­trieved Snape’s wand from the bed. He ap­proached Lupin and the strug­gling rat, and his wet eyes sud­den­ly seemed to be burn­ing in his face.

‘To­geth­er?’ he said qui­et­ly.

‘I think so,’ said Lupin, hold­ing Scab­bers tight­ly in one hand and his wand in the oth­er. ‘On the count of three. One – two – THREE!’

A flash of blue-​white light erupt­ed from both wands; for a mo­ment, Scab­bers was frozen in mid-​air, his small black form twist­ing mad­ly – Ron yelled – the rat fell and hit the floor. There was an­oth­er blind­ing flash of light and then –

It was like watch­ing a speed­ed-​up film of a grow­ing tree. A head was shoot­ing up­wards from the ground; limbs were sprout­ing; next mo­ment, a man was stand­ing where Scab­bers had been, cring­ing and wring­ing his hands. Crook­shanks was spit­ting and snarling on the bed, the hair on his back stand­ing up.

He was a very short man, hard­ly taller than Har­ry and Hermione. His thin, colour­less hair was un­kempt and there was a large bald patch on top. He had the shrunk­en ap­pear­ance of a plump man who had lost a lot of weight in a short time. His skin looked grub­by, al­most like Scab­bers’s fur, and some­thing of the rat lin­gered around his point­ed nose, his very small, wa­tery eyes. He looked around at them all, his breath­ing fast and shal­low. Har­ry saw his eyes dart to the door and back again.

‘Well, hel­lo, Pe­ter,’ said Lupin pleas­ant­ly, as though rats fre­quent­ly erupt­ed in­to old school­friends around him. ‘Long time, no see.’

‘S-​Sir­ius … R-​Re­mus …’ Even Pet­ti­grew’s voice was squeaky. Again, his eyes dart­ed to­wards the door. ‘My friends … my old friends …’

Black’s wand arm rose, but Lupin seized him around the wrist, gave him a warn­ing look, then turned again to Pet­ti­grew, his voice light and ca­su­al.

‘We’ve been hav­ing a lit­tle chat, Pe­ter, about what hap­pened the night Lily and James died. You might have missed the fin­er points while you were squeak­ing around down there on the bed –’

‘Re­mus,’ gasped Pet­ti­grew, and Har­ry could see beads of sweat break­ing out over his pasty face, ‘you don’t be­lieve him, do you … He tried to kill me, Re­mus …’

‘So we’ve heard,’ said Lupin, more cold­ly. ‘I’d like to clear up one or two lit­tle mat­ters with you, Pe­ter, if you’d be so –’

‘He’s come to try and kill me again!’ Pet­ti­grew shrieked sud­den­ly, point­ing at Black, and Har­ry saw that he used his mid­dle fin­ger, be­cause his in­dex was miss­ing. ‘He killed Lily and James and now he’s go­ing to kill me, too … you’ve got to help me, Re­mus …’

Black’s face looked more skull-​like than ev­er as he stared at Pet­ti­grew with his fath­om­less eyes.

‘No one’s go­ing to try and kill you un­til we’ve sort­ed a few things out,’ said Lupin.

‘Sort­ed things out?’ squealed Pet­ti­grew, look­ing wild­ly about him once more, eyes tak­ing in the board­ed win­dows and, again, the on­ly door. ‘I knew he’d come af­ter me! I knew he’d be back for me! I’ve been wait­ing for this for twelve years!’

‘You knew Sir­ius was go­ing to break out of Azk­aban?’ said Lupin, his brow fur­rowed. ‘When no­body has ev­er done it be­fore?’

‘He’s got dark pow­ers the rest of us can on­ly dream of!’ Pet­ti­grew shout­ed shril­ly. ‘How else did he get out of there? I sup­pose He Who Must Not Be Named taught him a few tricks!’

Black start­ed to laugh, a hor­ri­ble, mirth­less laugh that filled the whole room.

‘Volde­mort, teach me tricks?’ he said.

Pet­ti­grew flinched as though Black had bran­dished a whip at him.

‘What, scared to hear your old mas­ter’s name?’ said Black. ‘I don’t blame you, Pe­ter. His lot aren’t very hap­py with you, are they?’

‘Don’t know – what you mean, Sir­ius –’ mut­tered Pet­ti­grew, his breath­ing faster than ev­er. His whole face was shin­ing with sweat now.

‘You haven’t been hid­ing from me for twelve years,’ said Black. ‘You’ve been hid­ing from Volde­mort’s old sup­port­ers. I heard things in Azk­aban, Pe­ter … they all think you’re dead, or you’d have to an­swer to them … I’ve heard them scream­ing all sorts of things in their sleep. Sounds like they think the dou­ble-​cross­er dou­ble-​crossed them. Volde­mort went to the Pot­ters’ on your in­for­ma­tion … and Volde­mort met his down­fall there. And not all Volde­mort’s sup­port­ers end­ed up in Azk­aban, did they? There are still plen­ty out here, bid­ing their time, pre­tend­ing they’ve seen the er­ror of their ways … If they ev­er got wind that you were still alive, Pe­ter –’

‘Don’t know … what you’re talk­ing about …’ said Pet­ti­grew again, more shril­ly than ev­er. He wiped his face on his sleeve and looked up at Lupin. ‘You don’t be­lieve this – this mad­ness, Re­mus –’

‘I must ad­mit, Pe­ter, I have dif­fi­cul­ty in un­der­stand­ing why an in­no­cent man would want to spend twelve years as a rat,’ said Lupin even­ly.

‘In­no­cent, but scared!’ squealed Pet­ti­grew. ‘If Volde­mort’s sup­port­ers were af­ter me, it was be­cause I put one of their best men in Azk­aban – the spy, Sir­ius Black!’

Black’s face con­tort­ed.

‘How dare you,’ he growled, sound­ing sud­den­ly like the bear-​sized dog he had been. ‘I, a spy for Volde­mort? When did I ev­er sneak around peo­ple who were stronger and more pow­er­ful than my­self? But you, Pe­ter – I’ll nev­er un­der­stand why I didn’t see you were the spy from the start. You al­ways liked big friends who’d look af­ter you, didn’t you? It used to be us … me and Re­mus … and James …’

Pet­ti­grew wiped his face again; he was al­most pant­ing for breath.

‘Me, a spy … must be out of your mind … nev­er … don’t know how you can say such a –’

‘Lily and James on­ly made you Se­cret-​Keep­er be­cause I sug­gest­ed it,’ Black hissed, so ven­omous­ly that Pet­ti­grew took a step back­wards. ‘I thought it was the per­fect plan … a bluff … Volde­mort would be sure to come af­ter me, would nev­er dream they’d use a weak, tal­ent­less thing like you … it must have been the finest mo­ment of your mis­er­able life, telling Volde­mort you could hand him the Pot­ters.’

Pet­ti­grew was mut­ter­ing dis­tract­ed­ly; Har­ry caught words like ‘far-​fetched’ and ‘lu­na­cy’, but he couldn’t help pay­ing more at­ten­tion to the ashen colour of Pet­ti­grew’s face, and the way his eyes con­tin­ued to dart to­wards the win­dows and door.

‘Pro­fes­sor Lupin?’ said Hermione timid­ly. ‘Can – can I say some­thing?’

‘Cer­tain­ly, Hermione,’ said Lupin cour­te­ous­ly.

‘Well – Scab­bers – I mean, this – this man – he’s been sleep­ing in Har­ry’s dor­mi­to­ry for three years. If he’s work­ing for You Know Who, how come he nev­er tried to hurt Har­ry be­fore now?’

‘There!’ said Pet­ti­grew shril­ly, point­ing at Hermione with his maimed hand. ‘Thank you! You see, Re­mus? I have nev­er hurt a hair of Har­ry’s head! Why should I?’

‘I’ll tell you why,’ said Black. ‘Be­cause you nev­er did any­thing for any­one un­less you could see what was in it for you. Volde­mort’s been in hid­ing for twelve years, they say he’s half-​dead. You weren’t about to com­mit mur­der right un­der Al­bus Dum­ble­dore’s nose, for a wreck of a wiz­ard who’d lost all his pow­er, were you? You’d want to be quite sure he was the biggest bul­ly in the play­ground be­fore you went back to him, wouldn’t you? Why else did you find a wiz­ard fam­ily to take you in? Keep­ing an ear out for news, weren’t you, Pe­ter? Just in case your old pro­tec­tor re­gained strength, and it was safe to re­join him …’

Pet­ti­grew opened his mouth and closed it sev­er­al times. He seemed to have lost the abil­ity to talk.

‘Er – Mr Black – Sir­ius?’ said Hermione timid­ly.

Black jumped at be­ing ad­dressed like this and stared at Hermione as though be­ing spo­ken to po­lite­ly was some­thing he’d long for­got­ten.

‘If you don’t mind me ask­ing, how – how did you get out of Azk­aban, if you didn’t use Dark Mag­ic?’

‘Thank you!’ gasped Pet­ti­grew, nod­ding fran­ti­cal­ly at her. ‘Ex­act­ly! Pre­cise­ly what I –’

But Lupin si­lenced him with a look. Black was frown­ing slight­ly at Hermione, but not as though he was an­noyed with her. He seemed to be pon­der­ing his an­swer.

‘I don’t know how I did it,’ he said slow­ly. ‘I think the on­ly rea­son I nev­er lost my mind is that I knew I was in­no­cent. That wasn’t a hap­py thought, so the De­men­tors couldn’t suck it out of me … but it kept me sane and know­ing who I am … helped me keep my pow­ers … so when it all be­came … too much … I could trans­form in my cell … be­come a dog. De­men­tors can’t see, you know …’ He swal­lowed. They feel their way to­wards peo­ple by sens­ing their emo­tions … they could tell that my feel­ings were less – less hu­man, less com­plex when I was a dog … but they thought, of course, that I was los­ing my mind like ev­ery­one else in there, so it didn’t trou­ble them. But I was weak, very weak, and I had no hope of driv­ing them away from me with­out a wand …

‘But then I saw Pe­ter in that pic­ture … I re­alised he was at Hog­warts with Har­ry … per­fect­ly po­si­tioned to act, if one hint reached his ears that the Dark Side was gath­er­ing strength again …’

Pet­ti­grew was shak­ing his head, mouthing noise­less­ly, but star­ing all the while at Black as though hyp­no­tised.

‘… ready to strike the mo­ment he could be sure of al­lies … to de­liv­er the last Pot­ter to them. If he gave them Har­ry, who’d dare say he’d be­trayed Lord Volde­mort? He’d be wel­comed back with hon­ours …

‘So you see, I had to do some­thing. I was the on­ly one who knew Pe­ter was still alive …’

Har­ry re­mem­bered what Mr Weasley had told Mrs Weasley. ‘The guards say he’s been talk­ing in his sleep … al­ways the same words …‘He’s at Hog­warts’.’

‘It was as if some­one had lit a fire in my head, and the De­men­tors couldn’t de­stroy it … it wasn’t a hap­py feel­ing … it was an ob­ses­sion … but it gave me strength, it cleared my mind. So, one night when they opened my door to bring food, I slipped past them as a dog … it’s so much hard­er for them to sense an­imal emo­tions that they were con­fused … I was thin, very thin … thin enough to slip through the bars … I swam as a dog back to the main­land … I jour­neyed north and slipped in­to the Hog­warts grounds as a dog … I’ve been liv­ing in the For­est ev­er since … ex­cept when I come to watch the Quid­ditch, of course … you fly as well as your fa­ther did, Har­ry …’

He looked at Har­ry, who did not look away.

‘Be­lieve me,’ croaked Black. ‘Be­lieve me. I nev­er be­trayed James and Lily. I would have died be­fore I be­trayed them.’

And at long last, Har­ry be­lieved him. Throat too tight to speak, he nod­ded.

‘No!’

Pet­ti­grew had fall­en to his knees as though Har­ry’s nod had been his own death sen­tence. He shuf­fled for­ward on his knees, grov­el­ling, his hands clasped in front of him as though pray­ing.

‘Sir­ius – it’s me … it’s Pe­ter … your friend … you wouldn’t …’

Black kicked out and Pet­ti­grew re­coiled.

‘There’s enough filth on my robes with­out you touch­ing them,’ said Black.

‘Re­mus!’ Pet­ti­grew squeaked, turn­ing to Lupin in­stead, writhing im­plor­ing­ly in front of him. ‘You don’t be­lieve this … Wouldn’t Sir­ius have told you they’d changed the plan?’

‘Not if he thought I was the spy, Pe­ter,’ said Lupin. ‘I as­sume that’s why you didn’t tell me, Sir­ius?’ he said ca­su­al­ly over Pet­ti­grew’s head.

‘For­give me, Re­mus,’ said Black.

‘Not at all, Pad­foot, old friend,’ said Lupin, who was now rolling up his sleeves. ‘And will you, in turn, for­give me for be­liev­ing you were the spy?’

‘Of course,’ said Black, and the ghost of a grin flit­ted across his gaunt face. He, too, be­gan rolling up his sleeves. ‘Shall we kill him to­geth­er?’

‘Yes, I think so,’ said Lupin grim­ly.

‘You wouldn’t … you won’t …’ gasped Pet­ti­grew. And he scram­bled around to Ron.

‘Ron … haven’t I been a good friend … a good pet? You won’t let them kill me, Ron, will you … you’re on my side, aren’t you?’

But Ron was star­ing at Pet­ti­grew with the ut­most re­vul­sion.

‘I let you sleep in my bed!’ he said.

‘Kind boy … kind mas­ter …’ Pet­ti­grew crawled to­wards Ron, ‘you won’t let them do it … I was your rat … I was a good pet …’

‘If you made a bet­ter rat than hu­man, it’s not much to boast about, Pe­ter,’ said Black harsh­ly. Ron, go­ing still paler with pain, wrenched his bro­ken leg out of Pet­ti­grew’s reach. Pet­ti­grew turned on his knees, stag­gered for­wards and seized the hem of Hermione’s robes.

‘Sweet girl … clever girl … you – you won’t let them … help me …’

Hermione pulled her robes out of Pet­ti­grew’s clutch­ing hands and backed away against the wall, look­ing hor­ri­fied.

Pet­ti­grew knelt, trem­bling un­con­trol­lably, and turned his head slow­ly to­wards Har­ry.

‘Har­ry … Har­ry … you look just like your fa­ther … just like him …’

‘HOW DARE YOU SPEAK TO HAR­RY?’ roared Black. ‘HOW DARE YOU FACE HIM? HOW DARE YOU TALK ABOUT JAMES IN FRONT OF HIM?’

‘Har­ry’ whis­pered Pet­ti­grew, shuf­fling to­wards him, hands out­stretched, ‘Har­ry, James wouldn’t have want­ed me killed … James would have un­der­stood, Har­ry … he would have shown me mer­cy …’

Both Black and Lupin strode for­wards, seized Pet­ti­grew’s shoul­ders and threw him back­wards on­to the floor. He sat there, twitch­ing with ter­ror, star­ing up at them.

‘You sold Lily and James to Volde­mort,’ said Black, who was shak­ing too. ‘Do you de­ny it?’

Pet­ti­grew burst in­to tears. It was hor­ri­ble to watch: he looked like an over­sized, bald­ing ba­by, cow­er­ing on the floor.

‘Sir­ius, Sir­ius, what could I have done? The Dark Lord … you have no idea … he has weapons you can’t imag­ine … I was scared, Sir­ius, I was nev­er brave like you and Re­mus and James. I nev­er meant it to hap­pen … He Who Must Not Be Named forced me –’

‘DON’T LIE!’ bel­lowed Black. ‘YOU’D BEEN PASS­ING IN­FOR­MA­TION TO HIM FOR A YEAR BE­FORE LILY AND JAMES DIED! YOU WERE HIS SPY!’

‘He – he was tak­ing over ev­ery­where!’ gasped Pet­ti­grew. ‘Wh-​what was there to be gained by re­fus­ing him?’

‘What was there to be gained by fight­ing the most evil wiz­ard who has ev­er ex­ist­ed?’ said Black, with a ter­ri­ble fury in his face. ‘On­ly in­no­cent lives, Pe­ter!’

‘You don’t un­der­stand!’ whined Pet­ti­grew. ‘He would have killed me, Sir­ius!’

‘THEN YOU SHOULD HAVE DIED!’ roared Black. ‘DIED RATHER THAN BE­TRAY YOUR FRIENDS, AS WE WOULD HAVE DONE FOR YOU!’

Black and Lupin stood shoul­der to shoul­der, wands raised.

‘You should have re­alised,’ said Lupin qui­et­ly. ‘If Volde­mort didn’t kill you, we would. Good­bye, Pe­ter.’

Hermione cov­ered her face with her hands and turned to the wall.

‘NO!’ Har­ry yelled. He ran for­wards, plac­ing him­self in front of Pet­ti­grew, fac­ing the wands. ‘You can’t kill him,’ he said breath­less­ly. ‘You can’t.’

Black and Lupin both looked stag­gered.

‘Har­ry, this piece of ver­min is the rea­son you have no par­ents,’ Black snarled. ‘This cring­ing bit of filth would have seen you die, too, with­out turn­ing a hair. You heard him. His own stink­ing skin meant more to him than your whole fam­ily.’

‘I know,’ Har­ry pant­ed. ‘We’ll take him up to the cas­tle. We’ll hand him over to the De­men­tors. He can go to Azk­aban … just don’t kill him.’

‘Har­ry!’ gasped Pet­ti­grew, and he flung his arms around Har­ry’s knees. ‘You – thank you – it’s more than I de­serve – thank you –’

‘Get off me,’ Har­ry spat, throw­ing Pet­ti­grew’s hands off him in dis­gust. ‘I’m not do­ing this for you. I’m do­ing it be­cause I don’t reck­on my dad would’ve want­ed his best friends to be­come killers – just for you.’

No one moved or made a sound ex­cept Pet­ti­grew, whose breath was com­ing in wheezes as he clutched his chest. Black and Lupin were look­ing at each oth­er. Then, with one move­ment, they low­ered their wands.

‘You’re the on­ly per­son who has the right to de­cide, Har­ry,’ said Black. ‘But think … think what he did …’

‘He can go to Azk­aban,’ Har­ry re­peat­ed. ‘If any­one de­serves that place, he does …’

Pet­ti­grew was still wheez­ing be­hind him.

‘Very well,’ said Lupin. ‘Stand aside, Har­ry.’

Har­ry hes­itat­ed.

‘I’m go­ing to tie him up,’ said Lupin. ‘That’s all, I swear.’

Har­ry stepped out of the way. Thin cords shot from Lupin’s wand this time, and next mo­ment, Pet­ti­grew was wrig­gling on the floor, bound and gagged.

‘But if you trans­form, Pe­ter,’ growled Black, his own wand point­ing at Pet­ti­grew, too, ‘we will kill you. You agree, Har­ry?’

Har­ry looked down at the piti­ful fig­ure on the floor, and nod­ded so that Pet­ti­grew could see him.

‘Right,’ said Lupin, sud­den­ly busi­ness-​like. ‘Ron, I can’t mend bones near­ly as well as Madam Pom­frey, so I think it’s best if we just strap your leg up un­til we can get you to the hos­pi­tal wing.’

He hur­ried over to Ron, bent down, tapped Ron’s leg with his wand and mut­tered, ‘Fer­ula.’ Ban­dages spun up Ron’s leg, strap­ping it tight­ly to a splint. Lupin helped him to his feet; Ron put his weight gin­ger­ly on the leg and didn’t wince.

‘That’s bet­ter,’ he said. ‘Thanks.’

‘What about Pro­fes­sor Snape?’ said Hermione in a small voice, look­ing down at Snape’s prone fig­ure.

‘There’s noth­ing se­ri­ous­ly wrong with him,’ said Lupin, bend­ing over Snape and check­ing his pulse. ‘You were just a lit­tle – over-​en­thu­si­as­tic. Still out cold. Er – per­haps it will be best if we don’t re­vive him un­til we’re safe­ly back in the cas­tle. We can take him like this …’

He mut­tered, ‘Mo­bil­icor­pus.’ As though in­vis­ible strings were tied to Snape’s wrists, neck and knees, he was pulled in­to a stand­ing po­si­tion, head still lolling un­pleas­ant­ly, like a grotesque pup­pet. He hung a few inch­es above the ground, his limp feet dan­gling. Lupin picked up the In­vis­ibil­ity Cloak and tucked it safe­ly in­to his pock­et.

‘And two of us should be chained to this,’ said Black, nudg­ing Pet­ti­grew with his toe. ‘Just to make sure.’

‘I’ll do it,’ said Lupin.

‘And me,’ said Ron sav­age­ly, limp­ing for­wards.

Black con­jured heavy man­acles from thin air; soon Pet­ti­grew was up­right again, left arm chained to Lupin’s right, right arm to Ron’s left. Ron’s face was set. He seemed to have tak­en Scab­bers’s true iden­ti­ty as a per­son­al in­sult. Crook­shanks leapt light­ly off the bed and led the way out of the room, his bot­tle-​brush tail held jaun­ti­ly high.
