CHAPTER ELEVEN


The Fire­bolt



Har­ry didn’t have a very clear idea of how he had man­aged to get back in­to the Hon­ey­dukes cel­lar, through the tun­nel and in­to the cas­tle once more. All he knew was that the re­turn trip seemed to take no time at all, and that he hard­ly no­ticed what he was do­ing, be­cause his head was still pound­ing with the con­ver­sa­tion he had just heard.

Why had no­body ev­er told him? Dum­ble­dore, Ha­grid, Mr Weasley, Cor­nelius Fudge … why hadn’t any­one ev­er men­tioned the fact that Har­ry’s par­ents had died be­cause their best friend had be­trayed them?

Ron and Hermione watched Har­ry ner­vous­ly all through din­ner, not dar­ing to talk about what they’d over­heard, be­cause Per­cy was sit­ting close by them. When they went up­stairs to the crowd­ed com­mon room, it was to find Fred and George had set off half-​a-​dozen Dung­bombs in a fit of end-​of-​term high spir­its. Har­ry, who didn’t want Fred and George ask­ing him whether he’d reached Hogsmeade or not, sneaked qui­et­ly up to the emp­ty dor­mi­to­ry, and head­ed straight for his bed­side cab­inet. He pushed his books aside and quick­ly found what he was look­ing for – the leather-​bound pho­to al­bum Ha­grid had giv­en him two years ago, which was full of wiz­ard pic­tures of his moth­er and fa­ther. He sat down on his bed, drew the hang­ings around him, and start­ed turn­ing the pages, search­ing, un­til …

He stopped on a pic­ture of his par­ents’ wed­ding day. There was his fa­ther wav­ing up at him, beam­ing, the un­tidy black hair Har­ry had in­her­it­ed stand­ing up in all di­rec­tions. There was his moth­er, alight with hap­pi­ness, arm in arm with his Dad. And there … that must be him. Their best man … Har­ry had nev­er giv­en him a thought be­fore.

If he hadn’t known it was the same per­son, he would nev­er have guessed it was Black in this old pho­to­graph. His face wasn’t sunken and waxy, but hand­some, full of laugh­ter. Had he al­ready been work­ing for Volde­mort when this pic­ture had been tak­en? Was he al­ready plan­ning the deaths of the two peo­ple next to him? Did he re­alise he was fac­ing twelve years in Azk­aban, twelve years which would make him un­recog­nis­able?

But the De­men­tors don’t af­fect him, Har­ry thought, star­ing in­to the hand­some, laugh­ing face. He doesn’t have to hear my Mum scream­ing if they get too close –

Har­ry slammed the al­bum shut, reached over and stuffed it back in­to his cab­inet, took off his robes and glass­es and got in­to bed, mak­ing sure the hang­ings were hid­ing him from view.

The dor­mi­to­ry door opened.

‘Har­ry?’ said Ron’s voice un­cer­tain­ly.

But Har­ry lay still, pre­tend­ing to be asleep. He heard Ron leave again, and rolled over on his back, his eyes wide open.

A ha­tred such as he had nev­er known be­fore was cours­ing through Har­ry like poi­son. He could see Black laugh­ing at him through the dark­ness, as though some­body had past­ed the pic­ture from the al­bum over his eyes. He watched, as though some­body was play­ing him a piece of film, Sir­ius Black blast­ing Pe­ter Pet­ti­grew (who re­sem­bled Neville Long­bot­tom) in­to a thou­sand pieces. He could hear (though he had no idea what Black’s voice might sound like) a low, ex­cit­ed mut­ter. ‘It has hap­pened, my Lord … the Pot­ters have made me their Se­cret-​Keep­er …’ And then came an­oth­er voice, laugh­ing shril­ly, the same laugh that Har­ry heard in­side his head when­ev­er the De­men­tors drew near …

*

‘Har­ry you – you look ter­ri­ble.’

Har­ry hadn’t got to sleep un­til day­break. He had awo­ken to find the dor­mi­to­ry de­sert­ed, dressed and gone down the spi­ral stair­case to a com­mon room that was com­plete­ly emp­ty ex­cept for Ron, who was eat­ing a Pep­per­mint Toad and mas­sag­ing his stom­ach, and Hermione, who had spread her home­work over three ta­bles.

‘Where is ev­ery­one?’ said Har­ry.

‘Gone! It’s the first day of the hol­idays, re­mem­ber?’ said Ron, watch­ing Har­ry close­ly. ‘It’s near­ly lunchtime, I was go­ing to come and wake you up in a minute.’

Har­ry slumped in­to a chair next to the fire. Snow was still falling out­side the win­dows. Crook­shanks was spread out in front of the fire like a large, gin­ger rug.

‘You re­al­ly don’t look well, you know,’ Hermione said, peer­ing anx­ious­ly in­to his face.

‘I’m fine,’ said Har­ry.

‘Har­ry, lis­ten,’ said Hermione, ex­chang­ing a look with Ron, ‘you must be re­al­ly up­set about what we heard yes­ter­day. But the thing is, you mustn’t go do­ing any­thing stupid.’

‘Like what?’ said Har­ry.

‘Like try­ing to go af­ter Black,’ said Ron sharply.

Har­ry could tell they had re­hearsed this con­ver­sa­tion while he had been asleep. He didn’t say any­thing.

‘You won’t, will you, Har­ry?’ said Hermione.

‘Be­cause Black’s not worth dy­ing for,’ said Ron.

Har­ry looked at them. They didn’t seem to un­der­stand at all.

‘D’you know what I see and hear ev­ery time a De­men­tor gets too near me?’ Ron and Hermione shook their heads, look­ing ap­pre­hen­sive. ‘I can hear my mum scream­ing and plead­ing with Volde­mort. And if you’d heard your mum scream­ing like that, just about to be killed, you wouldn’t for­get it in a hur­ry. And if you found out some­one who was sup­posed to be a friend of hers be­trayed her and sent Volde­mort af­ter her –’

‘There’s noth­ing you can do!’ said Hermione, look­ing strick­en. ‘The De­men­tors will catch Black and he’ll go back to Azk­aban and – and serve him right!’

‘You heard what Fudge said. Black isn’t af­fect­ed by Azk­aban like nor­mal peo­ple are. It’s not a pun­ish­ment for him like it is for the oth­ers.’

‘So what are you say­ing?’ said Ron, look­ing very tense. ‘You want to – to kill Black or some­thing?’

‘Don’t be sil­ly,’ said Hermione in a pan­icky voice. ‘Har­ry doesn’t want to kill any­one, do you, Har­ry?’

Again, Har­ry didn’t an­swer. He didn’t know what he want­ed to do. All he knew was that the idea of do­ing noth­ing, while Black was at lib­er­ty, was al­most more than he could stand.

‘Mal­foy knows,’ he said abrupt­ly. ‘Re­mem­ber what he said to me in Po­tions? ‘If it was me, I’d hunt him down my­self … I’d want re­venge.’’

‘You’re go­ing to take Mal­foy’s ad­vice in­stead of ours?’ said Ron fu­ri­ous­ly. ‘Lis­ten … you know what Pet­ti­grew’s moth­er got back af­ter Black had fin­ished with him? Dad told me – the Or­der of Mer­lin, First Class, and Pet­ti­grew’s fin­ger in a box. That was the biggest bit of him they could find. Black’s a mad­man, Har­ry, and he’s dan­ger­ous –’

‘Mal­foy’s dad must have told him,’ said Har­ry, ig­nor­ing Ron. ‘He was right in Volde­mort’s in­ner cir­cle –’

‘Say You-​Know-​Who, will you?’ in­ter­ject­ed Ron an­gri­ly.

‘– so ob­vi­ous­ly, the Mal­foys knew Black was work­ing for Volde­mort –’

‘– and Mal­foy’d love to see you blown in­to about a mil­lion pieces, like Pet­ti­grew! Get a grip, Mal­foy’s just hop­ing you’ll get your­self killed be­fore he has to play you at Quid­ditch.’

‘Har­ry please,’ said Hermione, her eyes now shin­ing with tears, ‘please be sen­si­ble. Black did a ter­ri­ble, ter­ri­ble thing, but d-​don’t put your­self in dan­ger, it’s what Black wants … oh, Har­ry, you’d be play­ing right in­to Black’s hands if you went look­ing for him. Your mum and dad wouldn’t want you to get hurt, would they? They’d nev­er want you to go look­ing for Black!’

‘I’ll nev­er know what they’d have want­ed be­cause, thanks to Black, I’ve nev­er spo­ken to them,’ said Har­ry short­ly.

There was a si­lence, in which Crook­shanks stretched lux­uri­ous­ly, flex­ing his claws. Ron’s pock­et quiv­ered.

‘Look,’ said Ron, ob­vi­ous­ly cast­ing around for a change of sub­ject, ‘it’s the hol­idays! It’s near­ly Christ­mas! Let’s – let’s go down and see Ha­grid. We haven’t vis­it­ed him for ages!’

‘No!’ said Hermione quick­ly. ‘Har­ry isn’t sup­posed to leave the cas­tle, Ron –’

‘Yeah, let’s go,’ said Har­ry, sit­ting up, ‘and I can ask him how come he nev­er men­tioned Black when he told me all about my par­ents!’

Fur­ther dis­cus­sion of Sir­ius Black plain­ly wasn’t what Ron had had in mind.

‘Or we could have a game of chess,’ he said hasti­ly, ‘or Gob­stones. Per­cy left a set –’

‘No, let’s vis­it Ha­grid,’ said Har­ry firm­ly.

So they got their cloaks from their dor­mi­to­ries and set off through the por­trait hole (‘Stand and fight, you yel­low-​bel­lied mon­grels!’), down through the emp­ty cas­tle and out through the oak front doors.

They made their way slow­ly down the lawn, mak­ing a shal­low trench in the glit­ter­ing, pow­dery snow, their socks and the hems of their cloaks soaked and freez­ing. The For­bid­den For­est looked as though it had been en­chant­ed, each tree smat­tered with sil­ver, and Ha­grid’s cab­in looked like an iced cake.

Ron knocked, but there was no an­swer.

‘He’s not out, is he?’ said Hermione, who was shiv­er­ing un­der her cloak.

Ron had his ear to the door.

‘There’s a weird noise,’ he said. ‘Lis­ten – is that Fang?’

Har­ry and Hermione put their ears to the door, too. From in­side the cab­in came a se­ries of low, throb­bing moans.

‘Think we’d bet­ter go and get some­one?’ said Ron ner­vous­ly.

‘Ha­grid!’ called Har­ry, thump­ing the door. ‘Ha­grid, are you in there?’

There was a sound of heavy foot­steps, then the door creaked open. Ha­grid stood there with his eyes red and swollen; tears splash­ing down the front of his leather waist­coat.

‘Yeh’ve heard!’ he bel­lowed, and he flung him­self on­to Har­ry’s neck.

Ha­grid be­ing at least twice the size of a nor­mal man, this was no laugh­ing mat­ter. Har­ry, about to col­lapse un­der Ha­grid’s weight, was res­cued by Ron and Hermione, who each seized Ha­grid un­der an arm and heaved him, Har­ry help­ing, back in­to the cab­in. Ha­grid al­lowed him­self to be steered in­to a chair and slumped over the ta­ble, sob­bing un­con­trol­lably, his face glazed with tears which dripped down in­to his tan­gled beard.

‘Ha­grid, what is it?’ said Hermione, aghast.

Har­ry spot­ted an of­fi­cial-​look­ing let­ter ly­ing open on the ta­ble.

‘What’s this, Ha­grid?’

Ha­grid’s sobs re­dou­bled, but he shoved the let­ter to­wards Har­ry, who picked it up and read aloud:



Dear Mr Ha­grid,

Fur­ther to our in­quiry in­to the at­tack by a Hip­pogriff on a stu­dent in your class, we have ac­cept­ed the as­sur­ances of Pro­fes­sor Dum­ble­dore that you bear no re­spon­si­bil­ity for the re­gret­table in­ci­dent.



‘Well, that’s OK, then, Ha­grid!’ said Ron, clap­ping Ha­grid on the shoul­der. But Ha­grid con­tin­ued to sob, and waved one of his gi­gan­tic hands, invit­ing Har­ry to read on.



How­ev­er, we must reg­is­ter our con­cern about the Hip­pogriff in ques­tion. We have de­cid­ed to up­hold the of­fi­cial com­plaint of Mr Lu­cius Mal­foy, and this mat­ter will there­fore be tak­en to the Com­mit­tee for the Dis­pos­al of Dan­ger­ous Crea­tures. The hear­ing will take place on April 20th, and we ask you to present your­self and your Hip­pogriff at the Com­mit­tee’s of­fices in Lon­don on that date. In the mean­time, the Hip­pogriff should be kept teth­ered and iso­lat­ed.

Yours in fel­low­ship …



There fol­lowed a list of the school gov­er­nors.

‘Oh,’ said Ron. ‘But you said Buck­beak isn’t a bad Hip­pogriff, Ha­grid. I bet he’ll get off –’

‘Yeh don’ know them gar­goyles at the Com­mit­tee fer the Dis­pos­al o’ Dan­ger­ous Crea­tures!’ choked Ha­grid, wip­ing his eyes on his sleeve. ‘They’ve got it in fer in­ter­estin’ crea­tures!’

A sud­den sound from the cor­ner of Ha­grid’s cab­in made Har­ry, Ron and Hermione whip around. Buck­beak the Hip­pogriff was ly­ing in the cor­ner, chomp­ing on some­thing that was ooz­ing blood all over the floor.

‘I couldn’ leave him tied up out there in the snow!’ choked Ha­grid. ‘All on his own! At Christ­mas!’

Har­ry, Ron and Hermione looked at each oth­er. They had nev­er seen eye to eye with Ha­grid about what he called ‘in­ter­est­ing crea­tures’ and oth­er peo­ple called ‘ter­ri­fy­ing mon­sters’. On the oth­er hand, there didn’t seem to be any par­tic­ular harm in Buck­beak. In fact, by Ha­grid’s usu­al stan­dards, he was pos­itive­ly cute.

‘You’ll have to put up a good strong de­fence, Ha­grid,’ said Hermione, sit­ting down and lay­ing a hand on Ha­grid’s mas­sive fore­arm. ‘I’m sure you can prove Buck­beak is safe.’

‘Won’ make no diff’rence!’ sobbed Ha­grid. ‘Them Dis­pos­al dev­ils, they’re all in Lu­cius Mal­foy’s pock­et! Scared o’ him! An’ if I lose the case, Buck­beak –’

Ha­grid drew his fin­ger swift­ly across his throat, then gave a great wail and lurched for­wards, his face in his arms.

‘What about Dum­ble­dore, Ha­grid?’ said Har­ry.

‘He’s done more’n enough fer me al­ready,’ groaned Ha­grid. ‘Got enough on his plate what with keepin’ them De­men­tors out­ta the cas­tle, an’ Sir­ius Black lurkin’ around –’

Ron and Hermione looked quick­ly at Har­ry, as though ex­pect­ing him to start be­rat­ing Ha­grid for not telling him the truth about Black. But Har­ry couldn’t bring him­self to do it, not now he saw Ha­grid so mis­er­able and scared.

‘Lis­ten, Ha­grid,’ he said, ‘you can’t give up. Hermione’s right, you just need a good de­fence. You can call us as wit­ness­es –’

‘I’m sure I’ve read about a case of Hip­pogriff-​bait­ing,’ said Hermione thought­ful­ly, ‘where the Hip­pogriff got off. I’ll look it up for you, Ha­grid, and see ex­act­ly what hap­pened.’

Ha­grid howled still more loud­ly. Har­ry and Hermione looked at Ron to help them.

‘Er – shall I make a cup of tea?’ said Ron.

Har­ry stared at him.

‘It’s what my mum does when­ev­er some­one’s up­set,’ Ron mut­tered, shrug­ging.

At last, af­ter many more as­sur­ances of help, with a steam­ing mug of tea in front of him, Ha­grid blew his nose on a hand­ker­chief the size of a table­cloth and said, ‘Yer right. I can’ af­ford to go ter pieces. Got­ta pull me­self to­geth­er …’

Fang the boarhound came timid­ly out from un­der the ta­ble and laid his head on Ha­grid’s knee.

‘I’ve not bin me­self late­ly’ said Ha­grid, stroking Fang with one hand and mop­ping his face with the oth­er. ‘Wor­ried abou’ Buck­beak, an’ no one likin’ me class­es –’

‘We do like them!’ lied Hermione at once.

‘Yeah, they’re great!’ said Ron, cross­ing his fin­gers un­der the ta­ble. ‘Er – how are the Flob­ber­worms?’

‘Dead,’ said Ha­grid gloomi­ly. ‘Too much let­tuce.’

‘Oh, no!’ said Ron, his lip twitch­ing.

‘An’ them De­men­tors make me feel rud­dy ter­ri­ble an’ all,’ said Ha­grid, with a sud­den shud­der. ‘Got­ta walk past ’em ev’ry time I want a drink in the Three Broom­sticks. ’S like bein’ back in Azk­aban –’

He fell silent, gulp­ing his tea. Har­ry, Ron and Hermione watched him breath­less­ly. They had nev­er heard Ha­grid talk about his brief spell in Azk­aban be­fore. Af­ter a brief pause, Hermione said timid­ly ‘Is it aw­ful in there, Ha­grid?’

‘Yeh’ve no idea,’ said Ha­grid qui­et­ly. ‘Nev­er bin any­where like it. Thought I was goin’ mad. Kep’ goin’ over hor­ri­ble stuff in me mind … the day I got ex­pelled from Hog­warts … day me Dad died … day I had ter let Nor­bert go …’

His eyes filled with tears. Nor­bert was the ba­by drag­on Ha­grid had once won in a game of cards.

‘Yeh can’ re­al­ly re­mem­ber who yeh are af­ter a while. An’ yeh can’ see the point o’ livin’ at all. I used ter hope I’d jus’ die in me sleep … when they let me out, it was like bein’ born again, ev’ry-​thin’ came flood­in’ back, it was the bes’ feel­in’ in the world. Mind, the De­men­tors weren’t keen on let­tin’ me go.’

‘But you were in­no­cent!’ said Hermione.

Ha­grid snort­ed.

‘Think that mat­ters to them? They don’ care. Long as they’ve got a cou­ple o’ hun­dred hu­mans stuck there with ’em, so they can leech all the hap­pi­ness out of ’em, they don’ give a damn who’s guilty an’ who’s not.’

Ha­grid went qui­et for a mo­ment, star­ing in­to his tea. Then he said qui­et­ly, ‘Thought o’ jus’ let­ting Buck­beak go … tryin’ ter make him fly away … but how d’yeh ex­plain ter a Hip­pogriff it’s got­ta go in­ter hidin’? An’ – an’ I’m scared o’ breakin’ the law …’ He looked up at them, tears leak­ing down his face again. ‘I don’ ev­er want ter go back ter Azk­aban.’

*

The trip to Ha­grid’s, though far from fun, had nev­er­the­less had the ef­fect Ron and Hermione had hoped. Though Har­ry had by no means for­got­ten about Black, he couldn’t brood con­stant­ly on re­venge if he want­ed to help Ha­grid win his case against the Com­mit­tee for the Dis­pos­al of Dan­ger­ous Crea­tures. He, Ron and Hermione went to the li­brary next day, and re­turned to the emp­ty com­mon room laden with books which might help pre­pare a de­fence for Buck­beak. The three of them sat in front of the roar­ing fire, slow­ly turn­ing the pages of dusty vol­umes about fa­mous cas­es of ma­raud­ing beasts, speak­ing oc­ca­sion­al­ly when they ran across some­thing rel­evant.

‘Here’s some­thing … there was a case in 1722 … but the Hip­pogriff was con­vict­ed – urgh, look what they did to it, that’s dis­gust­ing –’

‘This might help, look – a Man­ti­core sav­aged some­one in 1296, and they let the Man­ti­core off – oh – no, that was on­ly be­cause ev­ery­one was too scared to go near it …’

Mean­while, in the rest of the cas­tle, the usu­al mag­nif­icent Christ­mas dec­ora­tions had been put up, de­spite the fact that hard­ly any of the stu­dents re­mained to en­joy them. Thick stream­ers of hol­ly and mistle­toe were strung along the cor­ri­dors, mys­te­ri­ous lights shone from in­side ev­ery suit of ar­mour and the Great Hall was filled with its usu­al twelve Christ­mas trees, glit­ter­ing with gold­en stars. A pow­er­ful and de­li­cious smell of cook­ing per­vad­ed the cor­ri­dors, and by Christ­mas Eve, it had grown so strong that even Scab­bers poked his nose out of the shel­ter of Ron’s pock­et to sniff hope­ful­ly at the air.

On Christ­mas morn­ing, Har­ry was wo­ken by Ron throw­ing his pil­low at him.

‘Oy! Presents!’

Har­ry reached for his glass­es and put them on, squint­ing through the se­mi-​dark­ness to the foot of his bed, where a small heap of parcels had ap­peared. Ron was al­ready rip­ping the pa­per off his own presents.

‘An­oth­er jumper from Mum … ma­roon again … see if you’ve got one.’

Har­ry had. Mrs Weasley had sent him a scar­let jumper with the Gryffind­or li­on knit­ted on the front, al­so a dozen home-​baked mince pies, some Christ­mas cake and a box of nut brit­tle. As he moved all these things aside, he saw a long, thin pack­age ly­ing un­der­neath.

‘What’s that?’ said Ron, look­ing over, a fresh­ly un­wrapped pair of ma­roon socks in his hand.

‘Dun­no …’

Har­ry ripped the par­cel open and gasped as a mag­nif­icent, gleam­ing broom­stick rolled out on­to his bed­spread. Ron dropped his socks and jumped off his bed for a clos­er look.

‘I don’t be­lieve it,’ he said hoarse­ly.

It was a Fire­bolt, iden­ti­cal to the dream broom Har­ry had gone to see ev­ery day in Di­agon Al­ley. Its han­dle glit­tered as he picked it up. He could feel it vi­brat­ing, and let go; it hung in mid-​air, un­sup­port­ed, at ex­act­ly the right height for him to mount it. His eyes moved from the gold­en reg­is­tra­tion num­ber at the top of the han­dle right down to the per­fect­ly smooth, stream­lined birch twigs that made up the tail.

‘Who sent it to you?’ said Ron in a hushed voice.

‘Look and see if there’s a card,’ said Har­ry.

Ron ripped apart the Fire­bolt’s wrap­pings. ‘Noth­ing! Blimey, who’d spend that much on you?’

‘Well,’ said Har­ry, feel­ing stunned, ‘I’m bet­ting it wasn’t the Durs­leys.’

‘I bet it was Dum­ble­dore,’ said Ron, now walk­ing round and round the Fire­bolt, tak­ing in ev­ery glo­ri­ous inch. ‘He sent you the In­vis­ibil­ity Cloak anony­mous­ly …’

‘That was my dad’s, though,’ said Har­ry. ‘Dum­ble­dore was just pass­ing it on to me. He wouldn’t spend hun­dreds of Galleons on me. He can’t go giv­ing stu­dents stuff like this –’

‘That’s why he wouldn’t say it was from him!’ said Ron. ‘In case some git like Mal­foy said it was favouritism. Hey, Har­ry –’ Ron gave a great whoop of laugh­ter, ‘Mal­foy! Wait ’til he sees you on this! He’ll be sick as a pig! This is an in­ter­na­tion­al stan­dard broom, this is!’

‘I can’t be­lieve this,’ Har­ry mut­tered, run­ning a hand along the Fire­bolt, while Ron sank on­to Har­ry’s bed, laugh­ing his head off at the thought of Mal­foy. ‘Who –?’

‘I know,’ said Ron, con­trol­ling him­self. ‘I know who it could’ve been – Lupin!’

‘What?’ said Har­ry, now start­ing to laugh him­self. ‘Lupin? Lis­ten, if he had this much gold, he’d be able to buy him­self some new robes.’

‘Yeah, but he likes you,’ said Ron. ‘And he was away when your Nim­bus got smashed, and he might’ve heard about it and de­cid­ed to vis­it Di­agon Al­ley and get this for you –’

‘What d’you mean, he was away?’ said Har­ry. ‘He was ill when I was play­ing in that match.’

‘Well, he wasn’t in the hos­pi­tal wing,’ said Ron. ‘I was there, clean­ing out the bed­pans on that de­ten­tion from Snape, re­mem­ber?’

Har­ry frowned at Ron.

‘I can’t see Lupin af­ford­ing some­thing like this.’

‘What’re you two laugh­ing about?’

Hermione had just come in, wear­ing her dress­ing gown and car­ry­ing Crook­shanks, who was look­ing very grumpy, with a string of tin­sel tied around his neck.

‘Don’t bring him in here!’ said Ron, hur­ried­ly snatch­ing Scab­bers from the depths of his bed and stow­ing him in his py­ja­ma pock­et. But Hermione wasn’t lis­ten­ing. She dropped Crook­shanks on­to Sea­mus’s emp­ty bed and stared, open-​mouthed, at the Fire­bolt.

‘Oh, Har­ry! Who sent you that?’

‘No idea,’ said Har­ry. ‘There wasn’t a card or any­thing with it.’

To his great sur­prise, Hermione did not ap­pear ei­ther ex­cit­ed or in­trigued by this news. On the con­trary, her face fell, and she bit her lip.

‘What’s the mat­ter with you?’ said Ron.

‘I don’t know,’ said Hermione slow­ly, ‘but it’s a bit odd, isn’t it? I mean, this is sup­posed to be quite a good broom, isn’t it?’

Ron sighed ex­as­per­at­ed­ly.

‘It’s the best broom there is, Hermione,’ he said.

‘So it must’ve been re­al­ly ex­pen­sive …’

‘Prob­ably cost more than all the Slytherins’ brooms put to­geth­er,’ said Ron hap­pi­ly.

‘Well … who’d send Har­ry some­thing as ex­pen­sive as that, and not even tell him they’d sent it?’ said Hermione.

‘Who cares?’ said Ron, im­pa­tient­ly. ‘Lis­ten, Har­ry, can I have a go on it? Can I?’

‘I don’t think any­one should ride that broom just yet!’ said Hermione shril­ly.

Har­ry and Ron looked at her.

‘What d’you think Har­ry’s go­ing to do with it – sweep the floor?’ said Ron.

But be­fore Hermione could an­swer, Crook­shanks sprang from Sea­mus’s bed, right at Ron’s chest.

‘GET – HIM – OUT – OF – HERE!’ Ron bel­lowed, as Crook­shanks’s claws ripped his py­ja­mas and Scab­bers at­tempt­ed a wild es­cape over his shoul­der. Ron seized Scab­bers by the tail and aimed a mis­judged kick at Crook­shanks which hit the trunk at the end of Har­ry’s bed, knock­ing it over and caus­ing Ron to hop on the spot, howl­ing with pain.

Crook­shanks’s fur sud­den­ly stood on end. A shrill, tin­ny whistling was fill­ing the room. The Pock­et Sneako­scope had be­come dis­lodged from Un­cle Ver­non’s old socks and was whirling and gleam­ing on the floor.

‘I for­got about that!’ Har­ry said, bend­ing down and pick­ing up the Sneako­scope. ‘I nev­er wear those socks if I can help it …’

The Sneako­scope whirled and whis­tled in his palm. Crook­shanks was hiss­ing and spit­ting at it.

‘You’d bet­ter take that cat out of here, Hermione,’ said Ron fu­ri­ous­ly; he was sit­ting on Har­ry’s bed nurs­ing his toe. ‘Can’t you shut that thing up?’ he added to Har­ry, as Hermione strode out of the room, Crook­shanks’s yel­low eyes still fixed ma­li­cious­ly on Ron.

Har­ry stuffed the Sneako­scope back in­side the socks and threw it back in­to his trunk. All that could be heard now were Ron’s sti­fled moans of pain and rage. Scab­bers was hud­dled in Ron’s hands. It had been a while since Har­ry had seen him out of Ron’s pock­et, and he was un­pleas­ant­ly sur­prised to see that Scab­bers, once so fat, was now very skin­ny; patch­es of fur seemed to have fall­en out, too.

‘He’s not look­ing too good, is he?’ Har­ry said.

‘It’s stress!’ said Ron. ‘He’d be fine if that stupid great fur­ball left him alone!’

But Har­ry, re­mem­ber­ing what the wom­an at the Mag­ical Menagerie had said about rats on­ly liv­ing three years, couldn’t help feel­ing that un­less Scab­bers had pow­ers he had nev­er re­vealed, he was reach­ing the end of his life. And de­spite Ron’s fre­quent com­plaints that Scab­bers was both bor­ing and use­less, he was sure Ron would be very mis­er­able if Scab­bers died.

Christ­mas spir­it was def­inite­ly thin on the ground in the Gryffind­or com­mon room that morn­ing. Hermione had shut Crook­shanks in her dor­mi­to­ry, but was fu­ri­ous with Ron for try­ing to kick him; Ron was still fum­ing about Crook­shanks’s fresh at­tempt to eat Scab­bers. Har­ry gave up try­ing to make them talk to each oth­er, and de­vot­ed him­self to ex­am­in­ing the Fire­bolt, which he had brought down to the com­mon room with him. For some rea­son this seemed to an­noy Hermione as well; she didn’t say any­thing, but she kept look­ing dark­ly at the broom as though it, too, had been crit­icis­ing her cat.

At lunchtime they went down to the Great Hall, to find that the house ta­bles had been moved against the walls again, and that a sin­gle ta­ble, set for twelve, stood in the mid­dle of the room. Pro­fes­sors Dum­ble­dore, McG­ona­gall, Snape, Sprout and Flitwick were there, along with Filch, the care­tak­er, who had tak­en off his usu­al brown coat and was wear­ing a very old and rather mouldy look­ing tail coat. There were on­ly three oth­er stu­dents: two ex­treme­ly ner­vous-​look­ing first-​years, and a sullen-​faced Slytherin fifth-​year.

‘Mer­ry Christ­mas!’ said Dum­ble­dore, as Har­ry, Ron and Hermione ap­proached the ta­ble. ‘As there are so few of us, it seemed fool­ish to use the house ta­bles … sit down, sit down!’

Har­ry, Ron and Hermione sat down side by side at the end of the ta­ble.

‘Crack­ers!’ said Dum­ble­dore en­thu­si­as­ti­cal­ly, of­fer­ing the end of a large sil­ver one to Snape, who took it re­luc­tant­ly and tugged. With a bang like a gun­shot, the crack­er flew apart to re­veal a large, point­ed witch’s hat topped with a stuffed vul­ture.

Har­ry, re­mem­ber­ing the Bog­gart, caught Ron’s eye and they both grinned; Snape’s mouth thinned and he pushed the hat to­wards Dum­ble­dore, who swapped it for his wiz­ard’s hat at once.

‘Tuck in!’ he ad­vised the ta­ble, beam­ing around.

As Har­ry was help­ing him­self to roast pota­toes, the doors of the Great Hall opened again. It was Pro­fes­sor Trelawney, glid­ing to­wards them as though on wheels. She had put on a green se­quined dress in hon­our of the oc­ca­sion, mak­ing her look more than ev­er like a glit­ter­ing, over­size drag­on­fly.

‘Sybill, this is a pleas­ant sur­prise!’ said Dum­ble­dore, stand­ing up.

‘I have been crys­tal-​gaz­ing, Head­mas­ter,’ said Pro­fes­sor Trelawney, in her mist­iest, most far­away voice, ‘and to my as­ton­ish­ment, I saw my­self aban­don­ing my soli­tary lun­cheon and com­ing to join you. Who am I to refuse the prompt­ings of fate? I at once has­tened from my tow­er, and I do beg you to for­give my late­ness …’

‘Cer­tain­ly, cer­tain­ly,’ said Dum­ble­dore, his eyes twin­kling. ‘Let me draw you up a chair –’

And he did in­deed draw a chair in mid-​air with his wand, which re­volved for a few sec­onds be­fore falling with a thud be­tween Pro­fes­sors Snape and McG­ona­gall. Pro­fes­sor Trelawney, how­ev­er, did not sit down; her enor­mous eyes had been rov­ing around the ta­ble, and she sud­den­ly ut­tered a kind of soft scream.

‘I dare not, Head­mas­ter! If I join the ta­ble, we shall be thir­teen! Noth­ing could be more un­lucky! Nev­er for­get that when thir­teen dine to­geth­er, the first to rise will be the first to die!’

‘We’ll risk it, Sybill,’ said Pro­fes­sor McG­ona­gall im­pa­tient­ly. ‘Do sit down, the turkey’s get­ting stone cold.’

Pro­fes­sor Trelawney hes­itat­ed, then low­ered her­self in­to the emp­ty chair, eyes shut and mouth clenched tight, as though ex­pect­ing a thun­der­bolt to hit the ta­ble. Pro­fes­sor McG­ona­gall poked a large spoon in­to the near­est tureen. ‘Tripe, Sybill?’

Pro­fes­sor Trelawney ig­nored her. Eyes open again, she looked around once more and said, ‘But where is dear Pro­fes­sor Lupin?’

‘I’m afraid the poor fel­low is ill again,’ said Dum­ble­dore, in­di­cat­ing that ev­ery­body should start serv­ing them­selves. ‘Most un­for­tu­nate that it should hap­pen on Christ­mas Day.’

‘But sure­ly you al­ready knew that, Sybill?’ said Pro­fes­sor McG­ona­gall, her eye­brows raised.

Pro­fes­sor Trelawney gave Pro­fes­sor McG­ona­gall a very cold look.

‘Cer­tain­ly I knew, Min­er­va,’ she said qui­et­ly. ‘But one does not pa­rade the fact that one is All-​Know­ing. I fre­quent­ly act as though I am not pos­sessed of the In­ner Eye, so as not to make oth­ers ner­vous.’

‘That ex­plains a great deal,’ said Pro­fes­sor McG­ona­gall tart­ly.

Pro­fes­sor Trelawney’s voice sud­den­ly be­came a good deal less misty.

‘If you must know, Min­er­va, I have seen that poor Pro­fes­sor Lupin will not be with us for very long. He seems aware, him­self, that his time is short. He pos­itive­ly fled when I of­fered to crys­tal-​gaze for him –’

‘Imag­ine that,’ said Pro­fes­sor McG­ona­gall dri­ly.

‘I doubt,’ said Dum­ble­dore, in a cheer­ful but slight­ly raised voice, which put an end to Pro­fes­sor McG­ona­gall and Pro­fes­sor Trelawney’s con­ver­sa­tion, ‘that Pro­fes­sor Lupin is in any im­me­di­ate dan­ger. Severus, you’ve made the Po­tion for him again?’

‘Yes, Head­mas­ter,’ said Snape.

‘Good,’ said Dum­ble­dore. ‘Then he should be up and about in no time … Derek, have you had any of these chipo­latas? They’re ex­cel­lent.’

The first-​year boy went fu­ri­ous­ly red on be­ing ad­dressed di­rect­ly by Dum­ble­dore, and took the plat­ter of sausages with trem­bling hands.

Pro­fes­sor Trelawney be­haved al­most nor­mal­ly un­til the very end of Christ­mas din­ner, two hours lat­er. Full to burst­ing with Christ­mas din­ner and still wear­ing their crack­er hats, Har­ry and Ron got up first from the ta­ble and she shrieked loud­ly.

‘My dears! Which of you left his seat first? Which?’

‘Dun­no,’ said Ron, look­ing un­easi­ly at Har­ry.

‘I doubt it will make much dif­fer­ence,’ said Pro­fes­sor McG­ona­gall cold­ly, ‘un­less a mad axe-​man is wait­ing out­side the doors to slaugh­ter the first in­to the En­trance Hall.’

Even Ron laughed. Pro­fes­sor Trelawney looked high­ly af­front­ed.

‘Com­ing?’ Har­ry said to Hermione.

‘No,’ Hermione mut­tered. ‘I want a quick word with Pro­fes­sor McG­ona­gall.’

‘Prob­ably try­ing to see if she can take any more class­es,’ yawned Ron as they made their way in­to the En­trance Hall, which was com­plete­ly de­void of mad axe-​men.

When they reached the por­trait hole they found Sir Cado­gan en­joy­ing a Christ­mas par­ty with a cou­ple of monks, sev­er­al pre­vi­ous head­mas­ters of Hog­warts and his fat pony. He pushed up his vi­sor and toast­ed them with a flagon of mead.

‘Mer­ry – hic – Christ­mas! Pass­word?’

‘Scurvy cur,’ said Ron.

‘And the same to you, sir!’ roared Sir Cado­gan, as the paint­ing swung for­ward to ad­mit them.

Har­ry went straight up to the dor­mi­to­ry, col­lect­ed his Fire­bolt and the Broom­stick Ser­vic­ing Kit Hermione had giv­en him for his birth­day, brought them down­stairs and tried to find some­thing to do to the Fire­bolt; how­ev­er, there were no bent twigs to clip, and the han­dle was so shiny al­ready it seemed point­less to pol­ish it. He and Ron sim­ply sat ad­mir­ing it from ev­ery an­gle, un­til the por­trait hole opened, and Hermione came in, ac­com­pa­nied by Pro­fes­sor McG­ona­gall.

Though Pro­fes­sor McG­ona­gall was Head of Gryffind­or house, Har­ry had on­ly seen her in the com­mon room once be­fore, and that had been to make a very grave an­nounce­ment. He and Ron stared at her, both hold­ing the Fire­bolt. Hermione walked around them, sat down, picked up the near­est book and hid her face be­hind it.

‘So that’s it, is it?’ said Pro­fes­sor McG­ona­gall bead­ily, walk­ing over to the fire­side and star­ing at the Fire­bolt. ‘Miss Granger has just in­formed me that you have been sent a broom­stick, Pot­ter.’

Har­ry and Ron looked around at Hermione. They could see her fore­head red­den­ing over the top of her book, which was up­side-​down.

‘May I?’ said Pro­fes­sor McG­ona­gall, but she didn’t wait for an an­swer be­fore pulling the Fire­bolt out of their hands. She ex­am­ined it care­ful­ly from han­dle to twig-​ends. ‘Hmm. And there was no note at all, Pot­ter? No card? No mes­sage of any kind?’

‘No,’ said Har­ry blankly.

‘I see …’ said Pro­fes­sor McG­ona­gall. ‘Well, I’m afraid I will have to take this, Pot­ter.’

‘W-​what?’ said Har­ry, scram­bling to his feet. ‘Why?’

‘It will need to be checked for jinx­es,’ said Pro­fes­sor McG­ona­gall. ‘Of course, I’m no ex­pert, but I dare­say Madam Hooch and Pro­fes­sor Flitwick will strip it down –’

‘Strip it down?’ re­peat­ed Ron, as though Pro­fes­sor McG­ona­gall was mad.

‘It shouldn’t take more than a few weeks,’ said Pro­fes­sor McG­ona­gall. ‘You will have it back if we are sure it is jinx-​free.’

‘There’s noth­ing wrong with it!’ said Har­ry, his voice shak­ing slight­ly. ‘Hon­est­ly, Pro­fes­sor –’

‘You can’t know that, Pot­ter,’ said Pro­fes­sor McG­ona­gall, quite kind­ly, ‘not un­til you’ve flown it, at any rate, and I’m afraid that is out of the ques­tion un­til we are cer­tain that it has not been tam­pered with. I shall keep you in­formed.’

Pro­fes­sor McG­ona­gall turned on her heel and car­ried the Fire­bolt out of the por­trait hole, which closed be­hind her. Har­ry stood star­ing af­ter her, the tin of High-​Fin­ish Pol­ish still clutched in his hands. Ron, how­ev­er, round­ed on Hermione.

‘What did you go run­ning to McG­ona­gall for?’

Hermione threw her book aside. She was still pink in the face, but stood up and faced Ron de­fi­ant­ly.

‘Be­cause I thought – and Pro­fes­sor McG­ona­gall agrees with me – that that broom was prob­ably sent to Har­ry by Sir­ius Black!’
