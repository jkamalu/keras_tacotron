CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE


Hermione’s Se­cret



‘Shock­ing busi­ness … shock­ing … mir­acle none of them died … nev­er heard the like … by thun­der, it was lucky you were there, Snape …’

‘Thank you, Min­is­ter.’

‘Or­der of Mer­lin, Sec­ond Class, I’d say. First Class, if I can wan­gle it!’

‘Thank you very much in­deed, Min­is­ter.’

‘Nasty cut you’ve got there … Black’s work, I sup­pose?’

‘As a mat­ter of fact, it was Pot­ter, Weasley and Granger, Min­is­ter …’

‘No!’

‘Black had be­witched them, I saw it im­me­di­ate­ly. A Con­fun­dus Charm, to judge by their be­haviour. They seemed to think there was a pos­si­bil­ity he was in­no­cent. They weren’t re­spon­si­ble for their ac­tions. On the oth­er hand, their in­ter­fer­ence might have per­mit­ted Black to es­cape … they ob­vi­ous­ly thought they were go­ing to catch Black sin­gle-​hand­ed. They’ve got away with a great deal be­fore now … I’m afraid it’s giv­en them a rather high opin­ion of them­selves … and of course Pot­ter has al­ways been al­lowed an ex­traor­di­nary amount of li­cence by the Head­mas­ter –’

‘Ah, well, Snape … Har­ry Pot­ter, you know … we’ve all got a bit of a blind spot where he’s con­cerned.’

‘And yet – is it good for him to be giv­en so much spe­cial treat­ment? Per­son­al­ly I try to treat him like any oth­er stu­dent. And any oth­er stu­dent would be sus­pend­ed – at the very least – for lead­ing his friends in­to such dan­ger. Con­sid­er, Min­is­ter: against all school rules – af­ter all the pre­cau­tions put in place for his pro­tec­tion – out of bounds, at night, con­sort­ing with a were­wolf and a mur­der­er – and I have rea­son to be­lieve he has been vis­it­ing Hogsmeade il­le­gal­ly, too –’

‘Well, well … we shall see, Snape, we shall see … the boy has un­doubt­ed­ly been fool­ish …’

Har­ry lay lis­ten­ing with his eyes tight shut. He felt very grog­gy. The words he was hear­ing seemed to be trav­el­ling very slow­ly from his ears to his brain, so that it was dif­fi­cult to un­der­stand. His limbs felt like lead; his eye­lids too heavy to lift … he want­ed to lie here, on this com­fort­able bed, for ev­er …

‘What amazes me most is the be­haviour of the De­men­tors … you’ve re­al­ly no idea what made them re­treat, Snape?’

‘No, Min­is­ter. By the time I had come round they were head­ing back to their po­si­tions at the en­trances …’

‘Ex­traor­di­nary. And yet Black, and Har­ry, and the girl –’

‘All un­con­scious by the time I reached them. I bound and gagged Black, nat­ural­ly, con­jured stretch­ers and brought them all straight back to the cas­tle.’

There was a pause. Har­ry’s brain seemed to be mov­ing a lit­tle faster, and as it did, a gnaw­ing sen­sa­tion grew in the pit of his stom­ach …

He opened his eyes.

Ev­ery­thing was slight­ly blurred. Some­body had re­moved his glass­es. He was ly­ing in the dark hos­pi­tal wing. At the very end of the ward, he could make out Madam Pom­frey with her back to him, bend­ing over a bed. Har­ry squint­ed. Ron’s red hair was vis­ible be­neath Madam Pom­frey’s arm.

Har­ry moved his head over on the pil­low. In the bed to his right lay Hermione. Moon­light was falling across her bed. Her eyes were open, too. She looked pet­ri­fied, and when she saw that Har­ry was awake, pressed a fin­ger to her lips, then point­ed to the hos­pi­tal-​wing door. It was ajar, and the voic­es of Cor­nelius Fudge and Snape were com­ing through it from the cor­ri­dor out­side.

Madam Pom­frey now came walk­ing briskly up the dark ward to Har­ry’s bed. He turned to look at her. She was car­ry­ing the largest block of choco­late he had ev­er seen in his life. It looked like a small boul­der.

‘Ah, you’re awake!’ she said briskly. She placed the choco­late on Har­ry’s bed­side ta­ble and be­gan break­ing it apart with a small ham­mer.

‘How’s Ron?’ said Har­ry and Hermione to­geth­er.

‘He’ll live,’ said Madam Pom­frey grim­ly. ‘As for you two … you’ll be stay­ing here un­til I’m sat­is­fied you’re – Pot­ter, what do you think you’re do­ing?’

Har­ry was sit­ting up, putting his glass­es back on and pick­ing up his wand.

‘I need to see the Head­mas­ter,’ he said.

‘Pot­ter,’ said Madam Pom­frey sooth­ing­ly, ‘it’s all right. They’ve got Black. He’s locked away up­stairs. The De­men­tors will be per­form­ing the Kiss any mo­ment now –’

‘WHAT?’

Har­ry jumped up out of bed; Hermione had done the same. But his shout had been heard in the cor­ri­dor out­side; next sec­ond, Cor­nelius Fudge and Snape had en­tered the ward.

‘Har­ry Har­ry, what’s this?’ said Fudge, look­ing ag­itat­ed. ‘You should be in bed – has he had any choco­late?’ he asked Madam Pom­frey anx­ious­ly.

‘Min­is­ter, lis­ten!’ Har­ry said. ‘Sir­ius Black’s in­no­cent! Pe­ter Pet­ti­grew faked his own death! We saw him tonight! You can’t let the De­men­tors do that thing to Sir­ius, he’s –’

But Fudge was shak­ing his head with a small smile on his face.

‘Har­ry, Har­ry, you’re very con­fused, you’ve been through a dread­ful or­deal, lie back down, now, we’ve got ev­ery­thing un­der con­trol …’

‘YOU HAVEN’T!’ Har­ry yelled. ‘YOU’VE GOT THE WRONG MAN!’

‘Min­is­ter, lis­ten, please,’ Hermione said; she had hur­ried to Har­ry’s side and was gaz­ing im­plor­ing­ly in­to Fudge’s face. ‘I saw him, too. It was Ron’s rat, he’s an An­ima­gus, Pet­ti­grew, I mean, and –’

‘You see, Min­is­ter?’ said Snape. ‘Con­fund­ed, both of them … Black’s done a very good job on them …’

‘WE’RE NOT CON­FUND­ED!’ Har­ry roared.

‘Min­is­ter! Pro­fes­sor!’ said Madam Pom­frey an­gri­ly. ‘I must in­sist that you leave. Pot­ter is my pa­tient, and he should not be dis­tressed!’

‘I’m not dis­tressed, I’m try­ing to tell them what hap­pened!’ Har­ry said fu­ri­ous­ly. ‘If they’d just lis­ten –’

But Madam Pom­frey sud­den­ly stuffed a large chunk of choco­late in­to Har­ry’s mouth. He choked, and she seized the op­por­tu­ni­ty to force him back on­to the bed.

‘Now, please, Min­is­ter, these chil­dren need care. Please leave –’

The door opened again. It was Dum­ble­dore. Har­ry swal­lowed his mouth­ful of choco­late with great dif­fi­cul­ty, and got up again.

‘Pro­fes­sor Dum­ble­dore, Sir­ius Black –’

‘For heav­en’s sake!’ said Madam Pom­frey hys­ter­ical­ly. ‘Is this a hos­pi­tal wing or not? Head­mas­ter, I must in­sist –’

‘My apolo­gies, Pop­py, but I need a word with Mr Pot­ter and Miss Granger,’ said Dum­ble­dore calm­ly. ‘I have just been talk­ing to Sir­ius Black –’

‘I sup­pose he’s told you the same fairy tale he’s plant­ed in Pot­ter’s mind?’ spat Snape. ‘Some­thing about a rat, and Pet­ti­grew be­ing alive –’

‘That, in­deed, is Black’s sto­ry’ said Dum­ble­dore, sur­vey­ing Snape close­ly through his half-​moon spec­ta­cles.

‘And does my ev­idence count for noth­ing?’ snarled Snape. ‘Pe­ter Pet­ti­grew was not in the Shriek­ing Shack, nor did I see any sign of him in the grounds.’

‘That was be­cause you were knocked out, Pro­fes­sor!’ said Hermione earnest­ly. ‘You didn’t ar­rive in time to hear –’

‘Miss Granger, HOLD YOUR TONGUE!’

‘Now, Snape,’ said Fudge, star­tled, ‘the young la­dy is dis­turbed in her mind, we must make al­lowances –’

‘I would like to speak to Har­ry and Hermione alone,’ said Dum­ble­dore abrupt­ly. ‘Cor­nelius, Severus, Pop­py – please leave us.’

‘Head­mas­ter!’ splut­tered Madam Pom­frey. ‘They need treat­ment, they need rest –’

‘This can­not wait,’ said Dum­ble­dore. ‘I must in­sist.’

Madam Pom­frey pursed her lips and strode away in­to her of­fice at the end of the ward, slam­ming the door be­hind her. Fudge con­sult­ed the large gold pock­et watch dan­gling from his waist­coat.

‘The De­men­tors should have ar­rived by now,’ he said. ‘I’ll go and meet them. Dum­ble­dore, I’ll see you up­stairs.’

He crossed to the door and held it open for Snape, but Snape hadn’t moved.

‘You sure­ly don’t be­lieve a word of Black’s sto­ry?’ Snape whis­pered, his eyes fixed on Dum­ble­dore’s face.

‘I wish to speak to Har­ry and Hermione alone,’ Dum­ble­dore re­peat­ed.

Snape took a step to­wards Dum­ble­dore.

‘Sir­ius Black showed he was ca­pa­ble of mur­der at the age of six­teen,’ he breathed. ‘You haven’t for­got­ten that, Head­mas­ter? You haven’t for­got­ten that he once tried to kill me?’

‘My mem­ory is as good as it ev­er was, Severus,’ said Dum­ble­dore qui­et­ly.

Snape turned on his heel and marched through the door Fudge was still hold­ing. It closed be­hind them and Dum­ble­dore turned to Har­ry and Hermione. They both burst in­to speech at the same time.

‘Pro­fes­sor, Black’s telling the truth – we saw Pet­ti­grew –’

‘– he es­caped when Pro­fes­sor Lupin turned in­to a were­wolf –’

‘– he’s a rat –’

‘– Pet­ti­grew’s front paw, I mean, fin­ger, he cut it off –’

‘– Pet­ti­grew at­tacked Ron, it wasn’t Sir­ius –’

But Dum­ble­dore held up his hand to stem the flood of ex­pla­na­tions.

‘It is your turn to lis­ten, and I beg you will not in­ter­rupt me, be­cause there is very lit­tle time,’ he said qui­et­ly. ‘There is not a shred of proof to sup­port Black’s sto­ry, ex­cept your word – and the word of two thir­teen-​year-​old wiz­ards will not con­vince any­body. A street full of eye-​wit­ness­es swore they saw Sir­ius mur­der Pet­ti­grew. I my­self gave ev­idence to the Min­istry that Sir­ius had been the Pot­ters’ Se­cret-​Keep­er.’

‘Pro­fes­sor Lupin can tell you –’ Har­ry said, un­able to stop him­self.

‘Pro­fes­sor Lupin is cur­rent­ly deep in the For­est, un­able to tell any­one any­thing. By the time he is hu­man again, it will be too late, Sir­ius will be worse than dead. I might add that were­wolves are so mis­trust­ed by most of our kind that his sup­port will count for very lit­tle – and the fact that he and Sir­ius are old friends –’

‘But –’

‘Lis­ten to me, Har­ry. It is too late, you un­der­stand me? You must see that Pro­fes­sor Snape’s ver­sion of events is far more con­vinc­ing than yours.’

‘He hates Sir­ius,’ Hermione said des­per­ate­ly. ‘All be­cause of some stupid trick Sir­ius played on him –’

‘Sir­ius has not act­ed like an in­no­cent man. The at­tack on the Fat La­dy – en­ter­ing Gryffind­or Tow­er with a knife – with­out Pet­ti­grew, alive or dead, we have no chance of over­turn­ing Sir­ius’ sen­tence.’

‘But you be­lieve us.’

‘Yes, I do,’ said Dum­ble­dore qui­et­ly. ‘But I have no pow­er to make oth­er men see the truth, or to over­rule the Min­is­ter for Mag­ic …’

Har­ry stared up in­to the grave face and felt as though the ground be­neath him was falling sharply away. He had grown used to the idea that Dum­ble­dore could solve any­thing. He had ex­pect­ed Dum­ble­dore to pull some amaz­ing so­lu­tion out of the air. But no … their last hope was gone.

‘What we need,’ said Dum­ble­dore slow­ly, and his light-​blue eyes moved from Har­ry to Hermione, ‘is more time.’

‘But –’ Hermione be­gan. And then her eyes be­came very round. ‘OH!’

‘Now, pay at­ten­tion,’ said Dum­ble­dore, speak­ing very low, and very clear­ly. ‘Sir­ius is locked in Pro­fes­sor Flitwick’s of­fice on the sev­enth floor. Thir­teenth win­dow from the right of the West Tow­er. If all goes well, you will be able to save more than one in­no­cent life tonight. But re­mem­ber this, both of you. You must not be seen. Miss Granger, you know the law – you know what is at stake … you – must – not – be – seen.’

Har­ry didn’t have a clue what was go­ing on. Dum­ble­dore had turned on his heel and looked back as he reached the door.

‘I am go­ing to lock you in. It is –’ he con­sult­ed his watch, ‘five min­utes to mid­night. Miss Granger, three turns should do it. Good luck.’

‘Good luck?’ Har­ry re­peat­ed, as the door closed be­hind Dum­ble­dore. ‘Three turns? What’s he talk­ing about? What are we sup­posed to do?’

But Hermione was fum­bling with the neck of her robes, pulling from be­neath them a very long, very fine gold chain.

‘Har­ry come here,’ she said ur­gent­ly. ‘Quick!’

Har­ry moved to­wards her, com­plete­ly be­wil­dered. She was hold­ing the chain out. He saw a tiny, sparkling hour­glass hang­ing from it.

‘Here –’

She had thrown the chain around his neck, too.

‘Ready?’ she said breath­less­ly.

‘What are we do­ing?’ Har­ry said, com­plete­ly lost.

Hermione turned the hour­glass over three times.

The dark ward dis­solved. Har­ry had the sen­sa­tion that he was fly­ing, very fast, back­wards. A blur of colours and shapes rushed past him; his ears were pound­ing. He tried to yell but couldn’t hear his own voice –

And then he felt sol­id ground be­neath his feet, and ev­ery­thing came in­to fo­cus again –

He was stand­ing next to Hermione in the de­sert­ed En­trance Hall and a stream of gold­en sun­light was falling across the paved floor from the open front doors. He looked wild­ly around at Hermione, the chain of the hour­glass cut­ting in­to his neck.

‘Hermione, what –?’

‘In here!’ Hermione seized Har­ry’s arm and dragged him across the hall to the door of a broom cup­board; she opened it, pushed him in­side amongst the buck­ets and mops, fol­lowed him in, then slammed the door be­hind them.

‘What – how – Hermione, what hap­pened?’

‘We’ve gone back in time,’ Hermione whis­pered, lift­ing the chain off Har­ry’s neck in the dark­ness. ‘Three hours back …’

Har­ry found his own leg and gave it a very hard pinch. It hurt a lot, which seemed to rule out the pos­si­bil­ity that he was hav­ing a very bizarre dream.

‘But –’

‘Shh! Lis­ten! Some­one’s com­ing! I think – I think it might be us!’

Hermione had her ear pressed against the cup­board door.

‘Foot­steps across the hall … yes, I think it’s us go­ing down to Ha­grid’s!’

‘Are you telling me,’ Har­ry whis­pered, ‘that we’re here in this cup­board and we’re out there, too?’

‘Yes,’ said Hermione, her ear still glued to the cup­board door. ‘I’m sure it’s us … it doesn’t sound like more than three peo­ple … and we’re walk­ing slow­ly be­cause we’re un­der the In­vis­ibil­ity Cloak –’

She broke off, still lis­ten­ing in­tent­ly.

‘We’ve gone down the front steps …’

Hermione sat down on an up­turned buck­et; look­ing des­per­ate­ly anx­ious, Har­ry want­ed a few ques­tions an­swered.

‘Where did you get that hour­glass thing?’

‘It’s called a Time-​Turn­er,’ Hermione whis­pered, ‘and I got it from Pro­fes­sor McG­ona­gall on our first day back. I’ve been us­ing it all year to get to all my lessons. Pro­fes­sor McG­ona­gall made me swear I wouldn’t tell any­one. She had to write all sorts of let­ters to the Min­istry of Mag­ic so I could have one. She had to tell them that I was a mod­el stu­dent, and that I’d nev­er, ev­er use it for any­thing ex­cept my stud­ies … I’ve been turn­ing it back so I could do hours over again, that’s how I’ve been do­ing sev­er­al lessons at once, see? But …

‘Har­ry, I don’t un­der­stand what Dum­ble­dore wants us to do. Why did he tell us to go back three hours? How’s that go­ing to help Sir­ius?’

Har­ry stared at her shad­owy face.

‘There must be some­thing that hap­pened around now he wants us to change,’ he said slow­ly. ‘What hap­pened? We were walk­ing down to Ha­grid’s three hours ago …’

‘This is three hours ago, and we are walk­ing down to Ha­grid’s,’ said Hermione. ‘We just heard our­selves leav­ing …’

Har­ry frowned; he felt as though he was screw­ing up his whole brain in con­cen­tra­tion.

‘Dum­ble­dore just said – just said we could save more than one in­no­cent life …’ And then it hit him. ‘Hermione, we’re go­ing to save Buck­beak!’

‘But – how will that help Sir­ius?’

‘Dum­ble­dore said – he just told us where the win­dow is – the win­dow of Flitwick’s of­fice! Where they’ve got Sir­ius locked up! We’ve got to fly Buck­beak up to the win­dow and res­cue Sir­ius! Sir­ius can es­cape on Buck­beak – they can es­cape to­geth­er!’

From what Har­ry could see of Hermione’s face, she looked ter­ri­fied.

‘If we man­age that with­out be­ing seen, it’ll be a mir­acle!’

‘Well, we’ve got to try, haven’t we?’ said Har­ry. He stood up and pressed his own ear against the door.

‘Doesn’t sound like any­one’s there … come on, let’s go …’

Har­ry pushed the cup­board door open. The En­trance Hall was de­sert­ed. As qui­et­ly and quick­ly as they could, they dart­ed out of the cup­board and down the stone steps. The shad­ows were al­ready length­en­ing, the tops of the trees in the For­bid­den For­est gild­ed once more with gold.

‘If any­one’s look­ing out of the win­dow –’ Hermione squeaked, look­ing up at the cas­tle be­hind them.

‘We’ll run for it,’ said Har­ry de­ter­mined­ly. ‘Straight in­to the For­est, all right? We’ll have to hide be­hind a tree or some­thing and keep a look­out –’

‘OK, but we’ll go round by the green­hous­es!’ said Hermione breath­less­ly. ‘We need to keep out of sight of Ha­grid’s front door, or we’ll see us! We must be near­ly at Ha­grid’s by now!’

Still work­ing out what she meant, Har­ry set off at a sprint, Hermione be­hind him. They tore across the veg­etable gar­dens to the green­hous­es, paused for a mo­ment be­hind them, then set off again, fast as they could, skirt­ing around the Whomp­ing Wil­low, tear­ing to­wards the shel­ter of the For­est …

Safe in the shad­ows of the trees, Har­ry turned around; sec­onds lat­er, Hermione ar­rived be­side him, pant­ing.

‘Right,’ she gasped, ‘we need to sneak over to Ha­grid’s. Keep out of sight, Har­ry …’

They made their way silent­ly through the trees, keep­ing to the very edge of the For­est. Then, as they glimpsed the front of Ha­grid’s house, they heard a knock up­on his door. They moved quick­ly be­hind a wide oak trunk and peered out from ei­ther side. Ha­grid had ap­peared in his door­way, shak­ing and white, look­ing around to see who had knocked. And Har­ry heard his own voice.

‘It’s us. We’re wear­ing the In­vis­ibil­ity Cloak. Let us in and we can take it off.’

‘Yeh shouldn’ve come!’ Ha­grid whis­pered. He stood back, then shut the door quick­ly.

‘This is the weird­est thing we’ve ev­er done,’ Har­ry said fer­vent­ly.

‘Let’s move along a bit,’ Hermione whis­pered. ‘We need to get near­er to Buck­beak!’

They crept through the trees un­til they saw the ner­vous Hip­pogriff, teth­ered to the fence around Ha­grid’s pump­kin patch.

‘Now?’ Har­ry whis­pered.

‘No!’ said Hermione. ‘If we steal him now, those Com­mit­tee peo­ple will think Ha­grid set him free! We’ve got to wait un­til they’ve seen he’s tied out­side!’

‘That’s go­ing to give us about six­ty sec­onds,’ said Har­ry. This was start­ing to seem im­pos­si­ble.

At that mo­ment, there was a crash of break­ing chi­na from in­side Ha­grid’s cab­in.

‘That’s Ha­grid break­ing the milk jug,’ Hermione whis­pered. ‘I’m go­ing to find Scab­bers in a mo­ment –’

Sure enough, a few min­utes lat­er, they heard Hermione’s shriek of sur­prise.

‘Hermione,’ said Har­ry sud­den­ly, ‘what if we – we just run in there, and grab Pet­ti­grew –’

‘No!’ said Hermione in a ter­ri­fied whis­per. ‘Don’t you un­der­stand? We’re break­ing one of the most im­por­tant wiz­ard­ing laws!

‘No­body’s sup­posed to change time, no­body! You heard Dum­ble­dore, if we’re seen –’

‘We’d on­ly be seen by our­selves and Ha­grid!’

‘Har­ry, what do you think you’d do if you saw your­self burst­ing in­to Ha­grid’s house?’ said Hermione.

‘I’d – I’d think I’d gone mad,’ said Har­ry, ‘or I’d think there was some Dark Mag­ic go­ing on –’

‘Ex­act­ly! You wouldn’t un­der­stand, you might even at­tack your­self! Don’t you see? Pro­fes­sor McG­ona­gall told me what aw­ful things have hap­pened when wiz­ards have med­dled with time … loads of them end­ed up killing their past or fu­ture selves by mis­take!’

‘OK!’ said Har­ry. ‘It was just an idea, I just thought –’

But Hermione nudged him, and point­ed to­wards the cas­tle. Har­ry moved his head a few inch­es to get a clear view of the dis­tant front doors. Dum­ble­dore, Fudge, the old Com­mit­tee mem­ber, and Mac­nair the ex­ecu­tion­er were com­ing down the steps.

‘We’re about to come out!’ Hermione breathed.

And sure enough, mo­ments lat­er, Ha­grid’s back door opened, and Har­ry saw him­self, Ron and Hermione walk­ing out of it with Ha­grid. It was, with­out a doubt, the strangest sen­sa­tion of his life, stand­ing be­hind the tree, and watch­ing him­self in the pump­kin patch.

‘It’s OK, Beaky, it’s OK …’ Ha­grid said to Buck­beak. Then he turned to Har­ry, Ron and Hermione. ‘Go on. Get goin’.’

‘Ha­grid, we can’t –’

‘We’ll tell them what re­al­ly hap­pened –’

‘They can’t kill him –’

‘Go! It’s bad enough with­out you lot in trou­ble an’ all!’

Har­ry watched the Hermione in the pump­kin patch throw the In­vis­ibil­ity Cloak over him­self and Ron.

‘Go quick. Don’ lis­ten …’

There was a knock on Ha­grid’s front door. The ex­ecu­tion par­ty had ar­rived. Ha­grid turned around and head­ed back in­to his cab­in, leav­ing the back door ajar. Har­ry watched the grass flat­ten in patch­es all around the cab­in and heard three pairs of feet re­treat­ing. He, Ron and Hermione had gone … but the Har­ry and Hermione hid­den in the trees could now hear what was hap­pen­ing in­side the cab­in through the back door.

‘Where is the beast?’ came the cold voice of Mac­nair.

‘Out – out­side,’ Ha­grid croaked.

Har­ry pulled his head out of sight as Mac­nair’s face ap­peared at Ha­grid’s win­dow, star­ing out at Buck­beak. Then they heard Fudge.

‘We – er – have to read you the of­fi­cial no­tice of ex­ecu­tion, Ha­grid. I’ll make it quick. And then you and Mac­nair need to sign it. Mac­nair, you’re sup­posed to lis­ten too, that’s pro­ce­dure –’

Mac­nair’s face van­ished from the win­dow. It was now or nev­er.

‘Wait here,’ Har­ry whis­pered to Hermione. ‘I’ll do it.’

As Fudge’s voice start­ed again, Har­ry dart­ed out from be­hind his tree, vault­ed the fence in­to the pump­kin patch and ap­proached Buck­beak.

‘It is the de­ci­sion of the Com­mit­tee for the Dis­pos­al of Dan­ger­ous Crea­tures that the Hip­pogriff Buck­beak, here­after called the con­demned, shall be ex­ecut­ed on the sixth of June at sun­down –’

Care­ful not to blink, Har­ry stared up in­to Buck­beak’s fierce or­ange eye once more, and bowed. Buck­beak sank to his scaly knees and then stood up again. Har­ry be­gan to fum­ble with the rope ty­ing Buck­beak to the fence.

‘… sen­tenced to ex­ecu­tion by be­head­ing, to be car­ried out by the Com­mit­tee’s ap­point­ed ex­ecu­tion­er, Walden Mac­nair …’

‘Come on, Buck­beak,’ Har­ry mur­mured, ‘come on, we’re go­ing to help you. Qui­et­ly … qui­et­ly …’

‘… as wit­nessed be­low. Ha­grid, you sign here …’

Har­ry threw all his weight on­to the rope, but Buck­beak had dug in his front feet.

‘Well, let’s get this over with,’ said the reedy voice of the Com­mit­tee mem­ber from in­side Ha­grid’s cab­in. ‘Ha­grid, per­haps it would be bet­ter if you stayed in­side –’

‘No, I – I wan’ ter be with him … I don’ wan’ him ter be alone –’

Foot­steps echoed from with­in the cab­in.

‘Buck­beak, move!’ Har­ry hissed.

Har­ry tugged hard­er on the rope around Buck­beak’s neck. The Hip­pogriff be­gan to walk, rustling its wings ir­ri­ta­bly. They were still ten feet away from the For­est, in plain view of Ha­grid’s back door.

‘One mo­ment, please, Mac­nair,’ came Dum­ble­dore’s voice. ‘You need to sign, too.’ The foot­steps stopped. Har­ry heaved on the rope. Buck­beak snapped his beak and walked a lit­tle faster.

Hermione’s white face was stick­ing out from be­hind a tree.

‘Har­ry, hur­ry!’ she mouthed.

Har­ry could still hear Dum­ble­dore’s voice talk­ing from with­in the cab­in. He gave the rope an­oth­er wrench. Buck­beak broke in­to a grudg­ing trot. They had reached the trees …

‘Quick! Quick!’ Hermione moaned, dart­ing out from be­hind her tree, seiz­ing the rope too and adding her weight to make Buck­beak move faster. Har­ry looked over his shoul­der; they were now blocked from sight; they couldn’t see Ha­grid’s gar­den at all.

‘Stop!’ he whis­pered to Hermione. ‘They might hear us –’

Ha­grid’s back door had opened with a bang. Har­ry, Hermione and Buck­beak stood quite still; even the Hip­pogriff seemed to be lis­ten­ing in­tent­ly.

Si­lence … then –

‘Where is it?’ said the reedy voice of the Com­mit­tee mem­ber. ‘Where is the beast?’

‘It was tied here!’ said the ex­ecu­tion­er fu­ri­ous­ly. ‘I saw it! Just here!’

‘How ex­traor­di­nary’ said Dum­ble­dore. There was a note of amuse­ment in his voice.

‘Beaky!’ said Ha­grid huski­ly.

There was a swish­ing noise, and the thud of an axe. The ex­ecu­tion­er seemed to have swung it in­to the fence in anger. And then came the howl­ing, and this time they could hear Ha­grid’s words through his sobs.

‘Gone! Gone! Bless his lit­tle beak, he’s gone! Mus­ta pulled him­self free! Beaky, yeh clever boy!’

Buck­beak start­ed to strain against the rope, try­ing to get back to Ha­grid. Har­ry and Hermione tight­ened their grip and dug their heels in­to the For­est floor to stop him.

‘Some­one un­tied him!’ the ex­ecu­tion­er was snarling. ‘We should search the grounds, the For­est –’

‘Mac­nair, if Buck­beak has in­deed been stolen, do you re­al­ly think the thief will have led him away on foot?’ said Dum­ble­dore, still sound­ing amused. ‘Search the skies, if you will … Ha­grid, I could do with a cup of tea. Or a large brandy.’

‘O’ – o’ course, Pro­fes­sor,’ said Ha­grid, who sound­ed weak with hap­pi­ness. ‘Come in, come in …’

Har­ry and Hermione lis­tened close­ly. They heard foot­steps, the soft curs­ing of the ex­ecu­tion­er, the snap of the door, and then si­lence once more.

‘Now what?’ whis­pered Har­ry, look­ing around.

‘We’ll have to hide in here,’ said Hermione, who looked very shak­en. ‘We need to wait un­til they’ve gone back to the cas­tle. Then we wait un­til it’s safe to fly Buck­beak up to Sir­ius’ win­dow. He won’t be there for an­oth­er cou­ple of hours , this is go­ing to be dif­fi­cult …’

She looked ner­vous­ly over her shoul­der in­to the depths of the For­est. The sun was set­ting now.

‘We’re go­ing to have to move,’ said Har­ry, think­ing hard. ‘We’ve got to be able to see the Whomp­ing Wil­low, or we won’t know what’s go­ing on.’

‘OK,’ said Hermione, get­ting a firmer grip on Buck­beak’s rope. ‘But we’ve got to keep out of sight, Har­ry, re­mem­ber …’

They moved around the edge of the For­est, dark­ness falling thick­ly around them, un­til they were hid­den be­hind a clump of trees through which they could make out the Wil­low.

‘There’s Ron!’ said Har­ry sud­den­ly.

A dark fig­ure was sprint­ing across the lawn and its shout echoed through the still night air.

‘Get away from him – get away – Scab­bers, come here –’

And then they saw two more fig­ures ma­te­ri­alise out of nowhere. Har­ry watched him­self and Hermione chas­ing af­ter Ron. Then he saw Ron dive.

‘Gotcha! Get off, you stink­ing cat –’

‘There’s Sir­ius!’ said Har­ry. The great shape of the dog had bound­ed out from the roots of the Wil­low. They saw him bowl Har­ry over, then seize Ron …

‘Looks even worse from here, doesn’t it?’ said Har­ry, watch­ing the dog pulling Ron in­to the roots. ‘Ouch – look, I just got wal­loped by the tree – and so did you – this is weird –’

The Whomp­ing Wil­low was creak­ing and lash­ing out with its low­er branch­es; they could see them­selves dart­ing here and there, try­ing to reach the trunk. And then the tree froze.

‘That was Crook­shanks press­ing the knot,’ said Hermione.

‘And there we go …’ Har­ry mut­tered. ‘We’re in.’

The mo­ment they dis­ap­peared, the tree be­gan to move again. Sec­onds lat­er, they heard foot­steps quite close by. Dum­ble­dore, Mac­nair, Fudge and the old Com­mit­tee mem­ber were mak­ing their way up to the cas­tle.

‘Right af­ter we’d gone down in­to the pas­sage!’ said Hermione. ‘If on­ly Dum­ble­dore had come with us …’

‘Mac­nair and Fudge would’ve come too,’ said Har­ry bit­ter­ly. ‘I bet you any­thing Fudge would’ve told Mac­nair to mur­der Sir­ius on the spot …’

They watched the four men climb the cas­tle steps and dis­ap­pear from view. For a few min­utes the scene was de­sert­ed. Then –

‘Here comes Lupin!’ said Har­ry, as they saw an­oth­er fig­ure sprint­ing down the stone steps and har­ing to­wards the Wil­low. Har­ry looked up at the sky. Clouds were ob­scur­ing the moon com­plete­ly.

They watched Lupin seize a bro­ken branch from the ground and prod the knot on the trunk. The tree stopped fight­ing, and Lupin, too, dis­ap­peared in­to the gap in its roots.

‘If he’d on­ly grabbed the Cloak,’ said Har­ry. ‘It’s just ly­ing there …’

He turned to Hermione.

‘If I just dashed out now and grabbed it, Snape’d nev­er be able to get it and –’

‘Har­ry, we mustn’t be seen!’

‘How can you stand this?’ he asked Hermione fierce­ly. ‘Just stand­ing here and watch­ing it hap­pen?’ He hes­itat­ed. ‘I’m go­ing to grab the Cloak!’

‘Har­ry, no!’

Hermione seized the back of Har­ry’s robes not a mo­ment too soon. Just then, they heard a burst of song. It was Ha­grid, mak­ing his way up to the cas­tle, singing at the top of his voice, and weav­ing slight­ly as he walked. A large bot­tle was swing­ing from his hands.

‘See?’ Hermione whis­pered. ‘See what would have hap­pened? We’ve got to keep out of sight! No, Buck­beak!’

The Hip­pogriff was mak­ing fran­tic at­tempts to get to Ha­grid again; Har­ry seized his rope, too, strain­ing to hold Buck­beak back. They watched Ha­grid me­an­der tipsi­ly up to the cas­tle. He was gone. Buck­beak stopped fight­ing to get away. His head drooped sad­ly.

Bare­ly two min­utes lat­er, the cas­tle doors flew open yet again, and Snape had come charg­ing out of them, run­ning to­wards the Wil­low.

Har­ry’s fists clenched as they watched Snape skid to a halt next to the tree, look­ing around. He grabbed the Cloak and held it up.

‘Get your filthy hands off it,’ Har­ry snarled un­der his breath.

‘Shh!’

Snape seized the branch Lupin had used to freeze the tree, prod­ded the knot, and van­ished from view as he put on the Cloak.

‘So that’s it,’ said Hermione qui­et­ly. ‘We’re all down there … and now we’ve just got to wait un­til we come back up again …’

She took the end of Buck­beak’s rope and tied it se­cure­ly around the near­est tree, then sat down on the dry ground, arms around her knees.

‘Har­ry, there’s some­thing I don’t un­der­stand … why didn’t the De­men­tors get Sir­ius? I re­mem­ber them com­ing, and then I think I passed out … there were so many of them …’

Har­ry sat down, too. He ex­plained what he’d seen; how, as the near­est De­men­tor had low­ered its mouth to Har­ry’s, a large sil­ver some­thing had come gal­lop­ing across the lake and forced the De­men­tors to re­treat.

Hermione’s mouth was slight­ly open by the time Har­ry had fin­ished.

‘But what was it?’

‘There’s on­ly one thing it could have been, to make the De­men­tors go,’ said Har­ry. ‘A re­al Pa­tronus. A pow­er­ful one.’

‘But who con­jured it?’

Har­ry didn’t say any­thing. He was think­ing back to the per­son he’d seen on the oth­er bank of the lake. He knew who he thought it had been … but how could it have been?

‘Didn’t you see what they looked like?’ said Hermione ea­ger­ly. ‘Was it one of the teach­ers?’

‘No,’ said Har­ry. ‘He wasn’t a teach­er.’

‘But it must have been a re­al­ly pow­er­ful wiz­ard, to drive all those De­men­tors away … If the Pa­tronus was shin­ing so bright­ly, didn’t it light him up? Couldn’t you see –?’

‘Yeah, I saw him,’ said Har­ry slow­ly. ‘But … maybe I imag­ined it … I wasn’t think­ing straight … I passed out right af­ter­wards …’

‘Who did you think it was?’

‘I think –’ Har­ry swal­lowed, know­ing how strange this was go­ing to sound. ‘I think it was my dad.’

Har­ry glanced up at Hermione and saw that her mouth was ful­ly open now. She was gaz­ing at him with a mix­ture of alarm and pity.

‘Har­ry, your dad’s – well – dead,’ she said qui­et­ly.

‘I know that,’ said Har­ry quick­ly.

‘You think you saw his ghost?’

‘I don’t know … no … he looked sol­id …’

‘But then –’

‘Maybe I was see­ing things,’ said Har­ry. ‘But … from what I could see … it looked like him … I’ve got pho­tos of him …’

Hermione was still look­ing at him as though wor­ried about his san­ity.

‘I know it sounds mad,’ said Har­ry flat­ly. He turned to look at Buck­beak, who was dig­ging his beak in­to the ground, ap­par­ent­ly search­ing for worms. But he wasn’t re­al­ly watch­ing Buck­beak.

He was think­ing about his fa­ther, and about his three old­est friends … Moony, Worm­tail, Pad­foot and Prongs … Had all four of them been out in the grounds tonight? Worm­tail had reap­peared this evening when ev­ery­one had thought he was dead – was it so im­pos­si­ble his fa­ther had done the same? Had he been see­ing things across the lake? The fig­ure had been too far away to see dis­tinct­ly … yet he had felt sure, for a mo­ment, be­fore he’d lost con­scious­ness …

The leaves over­head rus­tled faint­ly in the breeze. The moon drift­ed in and out of sight be­hind the shift­ing clouds. Hermione sat with her face turned to­wards the Wil­low, wait­ing.

And then, at last, af­ter over an hour …

‘Here we come!’ Hermione whis­pered.

She and Har­ry got to their feet. Buck­beak raised his head. They saw Lupin, Ron and Pet­ti­grew clam­ber­ing awk­ward­ly out of the hole in the roots. Then came Hermione … then the un­con­scious Snape, drift­ing weird­ly up­wards. Next came Har­ry and Black. They all be­gan to walk to­wards the cas­tle.

Har­ry’s heart was start­ing to beat very fast. He glanced up at the sky. Any mo­ment now, that cloud was go­ing to move aside and show the moon …

‘Har­ry,’ Hermione mut­tered, as though she knew ex­act­ly what he was think­ing, ‘we’ve got to stay put. We mustn’t be seen. There’s noth­ing we can do …’

‘So we’re just go­ing to let Pet­ti­grew es­cape all over again …’ said Har­ry qui­et­ly.

‘How do you ex­pect to find a rat in the dark?’ snapped Hermione. ‘There’s noth­ing we can do! We came back to help Sir­ius. We’re not sup­posed to be do­ing any­thing else!’

‘All right!’

The moon slid out from be­hind its cloud. They saw the tiny fig­ures across the grounds stop. Then they saw move­ment –

‘There goes Lupin,’ Hermione whis­pered. ‘He’s trans­form­ing –’

‘Hermione!’ said Har­ry sud­den­ly. ‘We’ve got to move!’

‘We mustn’t, I keep telling you –’

‘Not to in­ter­fere! But Lupin’s go­ing to run in­to the For­est, right at us!’

Hermione gasped.

‘Quick!’ she moaned, dash­ing to un­tie Buck­beak. ‘Quick! Where are we go­ing to go? Where are we go­ing to hide? The De­men­tors will be com­ing any mo­ment –’

‘Back to Ha­grid’s!’ Har­ry said. ‘It’s emp­ty now – come on!’

They ran, fast as they could, Buck­beak can­ter­ing along be­hind them. They could hear the were­wolf howl­ing be­hind them …

The cab­in was in sight. Har­ry skid­ded to the door, wrenched it open and Hermione and Buck­beak flashed past him; Har­ry threw him­self in af­ter them and bolt­ed the door. Fang the boarhound barked loud­ly.

‘Shh, Fang, it’s us!’ said Hermione, hur­ry­ing over and scratch­ing his ears to qui­eten him. ‘That was re­al­ly close!’ she said to Har­ry.

‘Yeah …’

Har­ry was look­ing out of the win­dow. It was much hard­er to see what was go­ing on from here. Buck­beak seemed very hap­py to find him­self back in­side Ha­grid’s house. He lay down in front of the fire, fold­ed his wings con­tent­ed­ly and seemed ready for a good nap.

‘I think I’d bet­ter go out­side again, you know,’ said Har­ry slow­ly. ‘I can’t see what’s go­ing on – we won’t know when it’s time –’

Hermione looked up. Her ex­pres­sion was sus­pi­cious.

‘I’m not go­ing to try and in­ter­fere,’ said Har­ry quick­ly. ‘But if we don’t see what’s go­ing on, how’re we go­ing to know when it’s time to res­cue Sir­ius?’

‘Well … OK, then … I’ll wait here with Buck­beak … but Har­ry, be care­ful – there’s a were­wolf out there – and the De­men­tors –’

Har­ry stepped out­side again and edged around the cab­in. He could hear yelp­ing in the dis­tance. That meant the De­men­tors were clos­ing in on Sir­ius … he and Hermione would be run­ning to him any mo­ment …

Har­ry stared out to­wards the lake, his heart do­ing a kind of drum-​roll in his chest. Who­ev­er had sent that Pa­tronus would be ap­pear­ing at any mo­ment.

For a frac­tion of a sec­ond he stood, ir­res­olute, in front of Ha­grid’s door. You must not be seen. But he didn’t want to be seen. He want­ed to do the see­ing … he had to know …

And there were the De­men­tors. They were emerg­ing out of the dark­ness from ev­ery di­rec­tion, glid­ing around the edges of the lake … they were mov­ing away from where Har­ry stood, to the op­po­site bank … he wouldn’t have to get near them …

Har­ry be­gan to run. He had no thought in his head ex­cept his fa­ther … If it was him … if it re­al­ly was him … he had to know, had to find out …

The lake was com­ing near­er and near­er, but there was no sign of any­body. On the op­po­site bank, he could see tiny glim­mers of sil­ver – his own at­tempts at a Pa­tronus –

There was a bush at the very edge of the wa­ter. Har­ry threw him­self be­hind it, peer­ing des­per­ate­ly through the leaves. On the op­po­site bank, the glim­mers of sil­ver were sud­den­ly ex­tin­guished. A ter­ri­fied ex­cite­ment shot through him – any mo­ment now –

‘Come on!’ he mut­tered, star­ing about. ‘Where are you? Dad, come on –’

But no one came. Har­ry raised his head to look at the cir­cle of De­men­tors across the lake. One of them was low­er­ing its hood. It was time for the res­cuer to ap­pear – but no one was com­ing to help this time –

And then it hit him – he un­der­stood. He hadn’t seen his fa­ther – he had seen him­self –

Har­ry flung him­self out from be­hind the bush and pulled out his wand.

‘EX­PEC­TO PA­TRON­UM!’ he yelled.

And out of the end of his wand burst, not a shape­less cloud of mist, but a blind­ing, daz­zling, sil­ver an­imal. He screwed up his eyes, try­ing to see what it was. It looked like a horse. It was gal­lop­ing silent­ly away from him, across the black sur­face of the lake. He saw it low­er its head and charge at the swarm­ing De­men­tors … now it was gal­lop­ing around and around the black shapes on the ground, and the De­men­tors were falling back, scat­ter­ing, re­treat­ing in­to the dark­ness … they were gone.

The Pa­tronus turned. It was can­ter­ing back to­wards Har­ry across the still sur­face of the wa­ter. It wasn’t a horse. It wasn’t a uni­corn, ei­ther. It was a stag. It was shin­ing bright­ly as the moon above … it was com­ing back to him …

It stopped on the bank. Its hooves made no mark on the soft ground as it stared at Har­ry with its large, sil­ver eyes. Slow­ly, it bowed its antlered head. And Har­ry re­alised …

‘Prongs,’ he whis­pered.

But as his trem­bling fin­ger­tips stretched to­wards the crea­ture, it van­ished.

Har­ry stood there, hand still out­stretched. Then, with a great leap of his heart, he heard hooves be­hind him – he whirled around and saw Hermione dash­ing to­wards him, drag­ging Buck­beak be­hind her.

‘What did you do?’ she said fierce­ly. ‘You said you were on­ly go­ing to keep a look­out!’

‘I just saved all our lives …’ said Har­ry. ‘Get be­hind here – be­hind this bush – I’ll ex­plain.’

Hermione lis­tened to what had just hap­pened with her mouth open yet again.

‘Did any­one see you?’

‘Yes, haven’t you been lis­ten­ing? I saw me but I thought I was my dad! It’s OK!’

‘Har­ry, I can’t be­lieve it – you con­jured up a Pa­tronus that drove away all those De­men­tors! That’s very, very ad­vanced mag­ic …’

‘I knew I could do it this time,’ said Har­ry, ‘be­cause I’d al­ready done it … Does that make sense?’

‘I don’t know – Har­ry, look at Snape!’

To­geth­er they peered around the bush at the oth­er bank. Snape had re­gained con­scious­ness. He was con­jur­ing stretch­ers and lift­ing the limp forms of Har­ry, Hermione and Black on­to them. A fourth stretch­er, no doubt bear­ing Ron, was al­ready float­ing at his side. Then, wand held out in front of him, he moved them away to­wards the cas­tle.

‘Right, it’s near­ly time,’ said Hermione tense­ly, look­ing at her watch. ‘We’ve got about forty-​five min­utes un­til Dum­ble­dore locks the door to the hos­pi­tal wing. We’ve got to res­cue Sir­ius and get back in­to the ward be­fore any­body re­alis­es we’re miss­ing …’

They wait­ed, watch­ing the mov­ing clouds re­flect­ed in the lake, while the bush next to them whis­pered in the breeze. Buck­beak, bored, was fer­ret­ing for worms again.

‘D’you reck­on he’s up there yet?’ said Har­ry, check­ing his watch. He looked up at the cas­tle, and be­gan count­ing the win­dows to the right of the West Tow­er.

‘Look!’ Hermione whis­pered. ‘Who’s that? Some­one’s com­ing back out of the cas­tle!’

Har­ry stared through the dark­ness. The man was hur­ry­ing across the grounds, to­wards one of the en­trances. Some­thing shiny glint­ed in his belt.

‘Mac­nair!’ said Har­ry. ‘The ex­ecu­tion­er! He’s gone to get the De­men­tors! This is it, Hermione –’

Hermione put her hands on Buck­beak’s back and Har­ry gave her a leg up. Then he placed his foot on one of the low­er branch­es of the bush and climbed up in front of her. He pulled Buck­beak’s rope back over his neck and tied it to the oth­er side of his col­lar like reins.

‘Ready?’ he whis­pered to Hermione. ‘You’d bet­ter hold on to me –’

He nudged Buck­beak’s sides with his heels.

Buck­beak soared straight in­to the dark air. Har­ry gripped his flanks with his knees, feel­ing the great wings ris­ing pow­er­ful­ly be­neath them. Hermione was hold­ing Har­ry very tight­ly around the waist; he could hear her mut­ter­ing, ‘Oh, no – I don’t like this – oh, I re­al­ly don’t like this –’

Har­ry urged Buck­beak for­wards. They were glid­ing qui­et­ly to­wards the up­per floors of the cas­tle … Har­ry pulled hard on the left-​hand side of the rope, and Buck­beak turned. Har­ry was try­ing to count the win­dows flash­ing past –

‘Whoa!’ he said, pulling back­wards as hard as he could.

Buck­beak slowed down and they found them­selves at a stop, un­less you count­ed the fact that they kept ris­ing up and down sev­er­al feet as he beat his wings to re­main air­borne.

‘He’s there!’ Har­ry said, spot­ting Sir­ius as they rose up be­side the win­dow. He reached out, and as Buck­beak’s wings fell, was able to tap sharply on the glass.

Black looked up. Har­ry saw his jaw drop. He leapt from his chair, hur­ried to the win­dow and tried to open it, but it was locked.

‘Stand back!’ Hermione called to him, and she took out her wand, still grip­ping the back of Har­ry’s robes with her left hand.

‘Alo­homo­ra!’

The win­dow sprang open.

‘How – how –?’ said Black weak­ly, star­ing at the Hip­pogriff.

‘Get on – there’s not much time,’ said Har­ry, grip­ping Buck­beak firm­ly on ei­ther side of his sleek neck to hold him steady. ‘You’ve got to get out of here – the De­men­tors are com­ing. Mac­nair’s gone to get them.’

Black placed a hand on ei­ther side of the win­dow-​frame and heaved his head and shoul­ders out of it. It was very lucky he was so thin. In sec­onds, he had man­aged to fling one leg over Buck­beak’s back, and pull him­self on­to the Hip­pogriff be­hind Hermione.

‘OK, Buck­beak, up!’ said Har­ry, shak­ing the rope. ‘Up to the tow­er – come on!’

The Hip­pogriff gave one sweep of its mighty wings and they were soar­ing up­wards again, high as the top of the West Tow­er. Buck­beak land­ed with a clat­ter on the bat­tle­ments and Har­ry and Hermione slid off him at once.

‘Sir­ius, you’d bet­ter go, quick,’ Har­ry pant­ed. ‘They’ll reach Flitwick’s of­fice any mo­ment, they’ll find out you’ve gone.’

Buck­beak pawed the ground, toss­ing his sharp head.

‘What hap­pened to the oth­er boy? Ron?’ said Sir­ius ur­gent­ly.

‘He’s go­ing to be OK – he’s still out of it, but Madam Pom­frey says she’ll be able to make him bet­ter. Quick – go!’

But Black was still star­ing down at Har­ry.

‘How can I ev­er thank –’

‘GO!’ Har­ry and Hermione shout­ed to­geth­er.

Black wheeled Buck­beak around, fac­ing the open sky.

‘We’ll see each oth­er again,’ he said. ‘You are – tru­ly your fa­ther’s son, Har­ry …’

He squeezed Buck­beak’s sides with his heels. Har­ry and Hermione jumped back as the enor­mous wings rose once more … the Hip­pogriff took off in­to the air … he and his rid­er be­came small­er and small­er as Har­ry gazed af­ter them … then a cloud drift­ed across the moon … they were gone.
