CHAPTER SIXTEEN


Pro­fes­sor Trelawney’s Pre­dic­tion



Har­ry’s eu­pho­ria at fi­nal­ly win­ning the Quid­ditch Cup last­ed at least a week. Even the weath­er seemed to be cel­ebrat­ing; as June ap­proached, the days be­came cloud­less and sul­try, and all any­body felt like do­ing was strolling in­to the grounds and flop­ping down on the grass with sev­er­al pints of iced pump­kin juice, per­haps play­ing a ca­su­al game of Gob­stones or watch­ing the gi­ant squid pro­pel it­self dream­ily across the sur­face of the lake.

But they couldn’t. The ex­ams were near­ly up­on them, and in­stead of laz­ing around out­side, the stu­dents were forced to re­main in­side the cas­tle, try­ing to bul­ly their brains in­to con­cen­trat­ing while en­tic­ing wafts of sum­mer air drift­ed in through the win­dows. Even Fred and George Weasley had been spot­ted work­ing; they were about to take their OWLs (Or­di­nary Wiz­ard­ing Lev­els). Per­cy was get­ting ready to sit his NEWTs (Nas­ti­ly Ex­haust­ing Wiz­ard­ing Tests), the high­est qual­ifi­ca­tion Hog­warts of­fered. As Per­cy hoped to en­ter the Min­istry of Mag­ic, he need­ed top grades. He was be­com­ing in­creas­ing­ly edgy, and gave very se­vere pun­ish­ments to any­body who dis­turbed the qui­et of the com­mon room in the evenings. In fact, the on­ly per­son who seemed more anx­ious than Per­cy was Hermione.

Har­ry and Ron had giv­en up ask­ing her how she was man­ag­ing to at­tend sev­er­al class­es at once, but they couldn’t re­strain them­selves when they saw the ex­am timetable she had drawn up for her­self. The first col­umn read:



MON­DAY

9 o’clock, Arith­man­cy

9 o’clock, Trans­fig­ura­tion

Lunch

1 o’clock, Charms

1 o’clock, An­cient Runes



‘Hermione?’ Ron said cau­tious­ly, be­cause she was li­able to ex­plode when in­ter­rupt­ed these days. ‘Er – are you sure you’ve copied down these times right?’

‘What?’ snapped Hermione, pick­ing up the ex­am timetable and ex­am­in­ing it. ‘Yes, of course I have.’

‘Is there any point ask­ing how you’re go­ing to sit two ex­ams at once?’ said Har­ry.

‘No,’ said Hermione short­ly. ‘Has ei­ther of you seen my copy of Nu­merol­ogy and Gram­mat­ica?’

‘Oh, yeah, I bor­rowed it for a bit of bed­time read­ing,’ said Ron, but very qui­et­ly. Hermione start­ed shift­ing heaps of parch­ment around on her ta­ble, look­ing for the book. Just then, there was a rus­tle at the win­dow and Hed­wig flut­tered through it, a note clutched tight­ly in her beak.

‘It’s from Ha­grid,’ said Har­ry, rip­ping the note open. ‘Buck­beak’s ap­peal – it’s set for the sixth.’

‘That’s the day we fin­ish our ex­ams,’ said Hermione, still look­ing ev­ery­where for her Arith­man­cy book.

‘And they’re com­ing up here to do it,’ said Har­ry, still read­ing from the let­ter. ‘Some­one from the Min­istry of Mag­ic and – and an ex­ecu­tion­er.’

Hermione looked up, star­tled.

‘They’re bring­ing the ex­ecu­tion­er to the ap­peal! But that sounds as though they’ve al­ready de­cid­ed!’

‘Yeah, it does,’ said Har­ry slow­ly.

‘They can’t!’ Ron howled. ‘I’ve spent ages read­ing up stuff for him, they can’t just ig­nore it all!’

But Har­ry had a hor­ri­ble feel­ing that the Com­mit­tee for the Dis­pos­al of Dan­ger­ous Crea­tures had had its mind made up for it by Mr Mal­foy. Dra­co, who had been no­tice­ably sub­dued since Gryffind­or’s tri­umph in the Quid­ditch fi­nal, seemed to re­gain some of his old swag­ger over the next few days. From sneer­ing com­ments Har­ry over­heard, Mal­foy was cer­tain Buck­beak was go­ing to be killed, and seemed thor­ough­ly pleased with him­self for bring­ing it about. It was all Har­ry could do to stop him­self im­itat­ing Hermione and hit­ting Mal­foy in the face on these oc­ca­sions. And the worst thing of all was that they had no time or op­por­tu­ni­ty to go and see Ha­grid, be­cause the strict new se­cu­ri­ty mea­sures had not been lift­ed, and Har­ry didn’t dare re­trieve his In­vis­ibil­ity Cloak from be­low the one-​eyed witch.

*

Ex­am week be­gan and an un­nat­ural hush fell over the cas­tle. The third-​years emerged from Trans­fig­ura­tion at lunchtime on Mon­day limp and ashen-​faced, com­par­ing re­sults and be­moan­ing the dif­fi­cul­ty of the tasks they had been set, which had in­clud­ed turn­ing a teapot in­to a tor­toise. Hermione ir­ri­tat­ed the rest by fuss­ing about how her tor­toise had looked more like a tur­tle, which was the least of ev­ery­one else’s wor­ries.

‘Mine still had a spout for a tail, what a night­mare …’

‘Were the tor­tois­es sup­posed to breathe steam?’

‘It still had a wil­low-​pat­terned shell, d’you think that’ll count against me?’

Then, af­ter a hasty lunch, it was straight back up­stairs for the Charms ex­am. Hermione had been right; Pro­fes­sor Flitwick did in­deed test them on Cheer­ing Charms. Har­ry slight­ly over­did his out of nerves and Ron, who was part­ner­ing him, end­ed up in fits of hys­ter­ical laugh­ter and had to be led away to a qui­et room for an hour be­fore he was ready to per­form the Charm him­self. Af­ter din­ner, the stu­dents hur­ried back to their com­mon rooms, not to re­lax, but to start re­vis­ing for Care of Mag­ical Crea­tures, Po­tions and As­tron­omy.

Ha­grid presid­ed over the Care of Mag­ical Crea­tures ex­am the fol­low­ing morn­ing with a very pre­oc­cu­pied air in­deed; his heart didn’t seem to be in it at all. He had pro­vid­ed a large tub of fresh Flob­ber­worms for the class, and told them that, to pass the test, their Flob­ber­worm had to still be alive at the end of one hour. As Flob­ber­worms flour­ished best if left to their own de­vices, it was the eas­iest ex­am any of them had ev­er sat, and al­so gave Har­ry, Ron and Hermione plen­ty of op­por­tu­ni­ty to speak to Ha­grid.

‘Beaky’s get­tin’ a bit de­pressed,’ Ha­grid told them, bend­ing low on the pre­tence of check­ing that Har­ry’s Flob­ber­worm was still alive. ‘Bin cooped up too long. But still … we’ll know day af­ter to­mor­row – one way or the oth­er.’

They had Po­tions that af­ter­noon, which was an un­qual­ified dis­as­ter. Try as Har­ry might, he couldn’t get his Con­fus­ing Con­coc­tion to thick­en, and Snape, stand­ing watch­ing with an air of vin­dic­tive plea­sure, scrib­bled some­thing that looked sus­pi­cious­ly like a ze­ro on­to his notes be­fore mov­ing away.

Then came As­tron­omy at mid­night, up on the tallest tow­er; His­to­ry of Mag­ic on Wednes­day morn­ing, in which Har­ry scrib­bled ev­ery­thing Flo­re­an Fortes­cue had ev­er told him about me­dieval witch hunts, while wish­ing he could have had one of Fortes­cue’s choco-​nut sun­daes with him in the sti­fling class­room. Wednes­day af­ter­noon meant Her­bol­ogy in the green­hous­es un­der a bak­ing hot sun; then back to the com­mon room once more, with the backs of their necks sun­burnt, think­ing long­ing­ly of this time next day, when it would all be over.

Their sec­ond from last ex­am, on Thurs­day morn­ing, was De­fence Against the Dark Arts. Pro­fes­sor Lupin had com­piled the most un­usu­al ex­am any of them had ev­er tak­en; a sort of ob­sta­cle course out­side in the sun, where they had to wade across a deep pad­dling pool con­tain­ing a Grindy­low, cross a se­ries of pot­holes full of Red Caps, squish their way across a patch of marsh, ig­nor­ing the mis­lead­ing di­rec­tions from a Hinky­punk, then climb in­to an old trunk and bat­tle with a new Bog­gart.

‘Ex­cel­lent, Har­ry,’ Lupin mut­tered, as Har­ry climbed out of the trunk, grin­ning. ‘Full marks.’

Flushed with his suc­cess, Har­ry hung around to watch Ron and Hermione. Ron did very well un­til he reached the Hinky­punk, which suc­cess­ful­ly con­fused him in­to sink­ing waist-​high in­to the quag­mire. Hermione did ev­ery­thing per­fect­ly un­til she reached the trunk with the Bog­gart in it. Af­ter about a minute in­side it, she burst out again, scream­ing.

‘Hermione!’ said Lupin, star­tled. ‘What’s the mat­ter?’

‘P-​P-​Pro­fes­sor McG­ona­gall!’ Hermione gasped, point­ing in­to the trunk. ‘Sh-​she said I’d failed ev­ery­thing!’

It took a lit­tle while to calm Hermione down. When at last she had re­gained a grip on her­self, she, Har­ry and Ron went back to the cas­tle. Ron was still slight­ly in­clined to laugh at Hermione’s Bog­gart, but an ar­gu­ment was avert­ed by the sight that met them on the top of the steps.

Cor­nelius Fudge, sweat­ing slight­ly in his pin­striped cloak, was stand­ing there star­ing out at the grounds. He start­ed at the sight of Har­ry.

‘Hel­lo there, Har­ry!’ he said. ‘Just had an ex­am, I ex­pect? Near­ly fin­ished?’

‘Yes,’ said Har­ry. Hermione and Ron, not be­ing on speak­ing terms with the Min­is­ter for Mag­ic, hov­ered awk­ward­ly in the back­ground.

‘Love­ly day,’ said Fudge, cast­ing an eye over the lake. ‘Pity … pity …’

He sighed deeply and looked down at Har­ry.

‘I’m here on an un­pleas­ant mis­sion, Har­ry. The Com­mit­tee for the Dis­pos­al of Dan­ger­ous Crea­tures re­quired a wit­ness to the ex­ecu­tion of a mad Hip­pogriff. As I need­ed to vis­it Hog­warts to check on the Black sit­ua­tion, I was asked to step in.’

‘Does that mean the ap­peal’s al­ready hap­pened?’ Ron in­ter­rupt­ed, step­ping for­wards.

‘No, no, it’s sched­uled for this af­ter­noon,’ said Fudge, look­ing cu­ri­ous­ly at Ron.

‘Then you might not have to wit­ness an ex­ecu­tion at all!’ said Ron stout­ly. ‘The Hip­pogriff might get off!’

Be­fore Fudge could an­swer, two wiz­ards came through the cas­tle doors be­hind him. One was so an­cient he ap­peared to be with­er­ing be­fore their very eyes; the oth­er was tall and strap­ping, with a thin black mous­tache. Har­ry gath­ered that they were rep­re­sen­ta­tives of the Com­mit­tee for the Dis­pos­al of Dan­ger­ous Crea­tures, be­cause the very old wiz­ard squint­ed to­wards Ha­grid’s cab­in and said in a fee­ble voice, ‘Dear, dear, I’m get­ting too old for this … two o’clock, isn’t it, Fudge?’

The black-​mous­tached man was fin­ger­ing some­thing in his belt; Har­ry looked and saw that he was run­ning one broad thumb along the blade of a shin­ing axe. Ron opened his mouth to say some­thing, but Hermione nudged him hard in the ribs and jerked her head to­wards the En­trance Hall.

‘Why’d you stop me?’ said Ron an­gri­ly, as they en­tered the Great Hall for lunch. ‘Did you see them? They’ve even got the axe ready! This isn’t jus­tice!’

‘Ron, your dad works for the Min­istry. You can’t go say­ing things like that to his boss!’ said Hermione, but she, too, looked very up­set. ‘As long as Ha­grid keeps his head this time, and ar­gues his case prop­er­ly, they can’t pos­si­bly ex­ecute Buck­beak …’

But Har­ry could tell Hermione didn’t re­al­ly be­lieve what she was say­ing. All around them, peo­ple were talk­ing ex­cit­ed­ly as they ate their lunch, hap­pi­ly an­tic­ipat­ing the end of ex­ams that af­ter­noon, but Har­ry, Ron and Hermione, lost in wor­ry about Ha­grid and Buck­beak, didn’t join in.

Har­ry and Ron’s last ex­am was Div­ina­tion; Hermione’s, Mug­gle Stud­ies. They walked up the mar­ble stair­case to­geth­er. Hermione left them on the first floor and Har­ry and Ron pro­ceed­ed all the way up to the sev­enth, where many of their class were sit­ting on the spi­ral stair­case to Pro­fes­sor Trelawney’s class­room, try­ing to cram in a bit of last-​minute re­vi­sion.

‘She’s see­ing us all sep­arate­ly,’ Neville in­formed them, as they went to sit down next to him. He had his copy of Un­fog­ging the Fu­ture open on his lap at the pages de­vot­ed to crys­tal-​gaz­ing. ‘Have ei­ther of you ev­er seen any­thing in a crys­tal ball?’ he asked them un­hap­pi­ly.

‘Nope,’ said Ron, in an off­hand voice. He kept check­ing his watch; Har­ry knew that he was count­ing down the time un­til Buck­beak’s ap­peal start­ed.

The queue of peo­ple out­side the class­room short­ened very slow­ly. As each per­son climbed back down the sil­ver lad­der, the rest of the class hissed, ‘What did she ask? Was it OK?’

But they all re­fused to say.

‘She says the crys­tal ball’s told her that, if I tell you, I’ll have a hor­ri­ble ac­ci­dent!’ squeaked Neville, as he clam­bered back down the lad­der to­wards Har­ry and Ron, who had now reached the land­ing.

‘That’s con­ve­nient,’ snort­ed Ron. ‘You know, I’m start­ing to think Hermione was right about her’ (he jabbed his thumb to­wards the trap­door over­head), ‘she’s a right old fraud.’

‘Yeah,’ said Har­ry, look­ing at his own watch. It was now two o’clock. ‘Wish she’d hur­ry up …’

Par­vati came back down the lad­der glow­ing with pride.

‘She says I’ve got all the mak­ings of a true Seer,’ she in­formed Har­ry and Ron. ‘I saw loads of stuff … well, good luck!’

She hur­ried off down the spi­ral stair­case to­wards Laven­der.

‘Ronald Weasley’ said the fa­mil­iar, misty voice from over their heads. Ron gri­maced at Har­ry, and climbed the sil­ver lad­der out of sight. Har­ry was now the on­ly per­son left to be test­ed. He set­tled him­self on the floor with his back against the wall, lis­ten­ing to a fly buzzing in the sun­ny win­dow, his mind across the grounds with Ha­grid.

Fi­nal­ly, af­ter about twen­ty min­utes, Ron’s large feet reap­peared on the lad­der.

‘How’d it go?’ Har­ry asked him, stand­ing up.

‘Rub­bish,’ said Ron. ‘Couldn’t see a thing, so I made some stuff up. Don’t think she was con­vinced, though …’

‘Meet you in the com­mon room,’ Har­ry mut­tered, as Pro­fes­sor Trelawney’s voice called, ‘Har­ry Pot­ter!’

The tow­er room was hot­ter than ev­er be­fore; the cur­tains were closed, the fire was alight, and the usu­al sick­ly scent made Har­ry cough as he stum­bled through the clut­ter of chairs and ta­bles to where Pro­fes­sor Trelawney sat wait­ing for him be­fore a large crys­tal ball.

‘Good day, my dear,’ she said soft­ly. ‘If you would kind­ly gaze in­to the Orb … take your time, now … then tell me what you see with­in it …’

Har­ry bent over the crys­tal ball and stared, stared as hard as he could, will­ing it to show him some­thing oth­er than swirling white fog, but noth­ing hap­pened.

‘Well?’ Pro­fes­sor Trelawney prompt­ed del­icate­ly. ‘What do you see?’

The heat was over­pow­er­ing and his nos­trils were sting­ing with the per­fumed smoke waft­ing from the fire be­side them. He thought of what Ron had just said, and de­cid­ed to pre­tend.

‘Er –,’ said Har­ry, ‘a dark shape … um …’

‘What does it re­sem­ble?’ whis­pered Pro­fes­sor Trelawney. ‘Think, now …’

Har­ry cast his mind around and it land­ed on Buck­beak.

‘A Hip­pogriff,’ he said firm­ly.

‘In­deed!’ whis­pered Pro­fes­sor Trelawney, scrib­bling keen­ly on the parch­ment perched up­on her knees. ‘My boy, you may well be see­ing the out­come of poor Ha­grid’s trou­ble with the Min­istry of Mag­ic! Look clos­er … does the Hip­pogriff ap­pear to … have its head?’

‘Yes,’ said Har­ry firm­ly.

‘Are you sure?’ Pro­fes­sor Trelawney urged him. ‘Are you quite sure, dear? You don’t see it writhing on the ground, per­haps, and a shad­owy fig­ure rais­ing an axe be­hind it?’

‘No!’ said Har­ry, start­ing to feel slight­ly sick.

‘No blood? No weep­ing Ha­grid?’

‘No!’ said Har­ry again, want­ing more than ev­er to leave the room and the heat. ‘It looks fine, it’s – fly­ing away …’

Pro­fes­sor Trelawney sighed. ‘Well, dear, I think we’ll leave it there … a lit­tle dis­ap­point­ing … but I’m sure you did your best.’

Re­lieved, Har­ry got up, picked up his bag and turned to go, but then a loud, harsh voice spoke be­hind him.

‘It will hap­pen tonight.’

Har­ry wheeled around. Pro­fes­sor Trelawney had gone rigid in her arm­chair; her eyes were un­fo­cused and her mouth sag­ging.

‘S-​sor­ry?’ said Har­ry.

But Pro­fes­sor Trelawney didn’t seem to hear him. Her eyes start­ed to roll. Har­ry stood there in a pan­ic. She looked as though she was about to have some sort of seizure. He hes­itat­ed, think­ing of run­ning to the hos­pi­tal wing – and then Pro­fes­sor Trelawney spoke again, in the same harsh voice, quite un­like her own:

‘The Dark Lord lies alone and friend­less, aban­doned by his fol­low­ers. His ser­vant has been chained these twelve years. Tonight, be­fore mid­night, the ser­vant will break free and set out to re­join his mas­ter. The Dark Lord will rise again with his ser­vant’s aid, greater and more ter­ri­ble than ev­er be­fore. Tonight … be­fore mid­night … the ser­vant … will set out re­join … his mas­ter …’

Pro­fes­sor Trelawney’s head fell for­wards on­to her chest. She made a grunt­ing sort of noise. Then, quite sud­den­ly, her head snapped up again.

‘I’m so sor­ry, dear boy,’ she said dream­ily. ‘The heat of the day, you know … I drift­ed off for a mo­ment …’

Har­ry stood there, still star­ing.

‘Is there any­thing wrong, my dear?’

‘You – you just told me that the – the Dark Lord’s go­ing to rise again … that his ser­vant’s go­ing to go back to him …’

Pro­fes­sor Trelawney looked thor­ough­ly star­tled.

‘The Dark Lord? He Who Must Not Be Named? My dear boy, that’s hard­ly some­thing to joke about … rise again, in­deed …’

‘But you just said it! You said the Dark Lord –’

‘I think you must have dozed off too, dear!’ said Pro­fes­sor Trelawney. ‘I would cer­tain­ly not pre­sume to pre­dict any­thing quite as far-​fetched as that!’

Har­ry climbed back down the lad­der and the spi­ral stair­case, won­der­ing … had he just heard Pro­fes­sor Trelawney make a re­al pre­dic­tion? Or had that been her idea of an im­pres­sive end to the test?

Five min­utes lat­er he was dash­ing past the se­cu­ri­ty trolls out­side the en­trance to Gryffind­or Tow­er, Pro­fes­sor Trelawney’s words still re­sound­ing in his head. Peo­ple were strid­ing past him in the op­po­site di­rec­tion, laugh­ing and jok­ing, head­ing for the grounds and a bit of long-​await­ed free­dom; by the time he had reached the por­trait hole and en­tered the com­mon room, it was al­most de­sert­ed. Over in a cor­ner, how­ev­er, sat Ron and Hermione.

‘Pro­fes­sor Trelawney’ Har­ry pant­ed, ‘just told me –’ But he stopped abrupt­ly at the sight of their faces. ‘Buck­beak lost,’ said Ron weak­ly. ‘Ha­grid’s just sent this.’ Ha­grid’s note was dry this time, no tears had splat­tered it, yet his hand seemed to have shak­en so much as he wrote that it was hard­ly leg­ible.



Lost ap­peal. They’re go­ing to ex­ecute at sun­set. Noth­ing you can do. Don’t come down. I don’t want you to see it.

Ha­grid



‘We’ve got to go,’ said Har­ry at once. ‘He can’t just sit there on his own, wait­ing for the ex­ecu­tion­er!’

‘Sun­set, though,’ said Ron, who was star­ing out of the win­dow in a glazed sort of way. ‘We’d nev­er be al­lowed … spe­cial­ly you, Har­ry …’

Har­ry sank his head in­to his hands, think­ing.

‘If we on­ly had the In­vis­ibil­ity Cloak …’

‘Where is it?’ said Hermione.

Har­ry told her about leav­ing it in the pas­sage­way un­der the one-​eyed witch.

‘… if Snape sees me any­where near there again, I’m in se­ri­ous trou­ble,’ he fin­ished.

‘That’s true,’ said Hermione, get­ting to her feet. ‘If he sees you … how do you open the witch’s hump again?’

‘You – you tap it and say, ‘Dis­sendi­um’,’ said Har­ry. ‘But –’

Hermione didn’t wait for the rest of his sen­tence; she strode across the room, pushed the Fat La­dy’s por­trait open and van­ished from sight.

‘She hasn’t gone to get it?’ Ron said, star­ing af­ter her.

She had. Hermione re­turned a quar­ter of an hour lat­er with the sil­very Cloak fold­ed care­ful­ly un­der her robes.

‘Hermione, I don’t know what’s got in­to you late­ly!’ said Ron, as­tound­ed. ‘First you hit Mal­foy, then you walk out on Pro­fes­sor Trelawney –’

Hermione looked rather flat­tered.

*

They went down to din­ner with ev­ery­body else, but did not re­turn to Gryffind­or Tow­er af­ter­wards. Har­ry had the Cloak hid­den down the front of his robes; he had to keep his arms fold­ed to hide the lump. They skulked in an emp­ty cham­ber off the En­trance Hall, lis­ten­ing, un­til they were sure it was de­sert­ed. They heard a last pair of peo­ple hur­ry­ing across the hall, and a door slam­ming. Hermione poked her head around the door.

‘OK,’ she whis­pered, ‘no one there – Cloak on –’

Walk­ing very close to­geth­er so that no­body would see them, they crossed the Hall on tip­toe be­neath the Cloak, then walked down the stone front steps in­to the grounds. The sun was al­ready sink­ing be­hind the For­bid­den For­est, gild­ing the top branch­es of the trees.

They reached Ha­grid’s cab­in and knocked. He was a minute in an­swer­ing, and when he did, he looked all around for his vis­itor, pale-​faced and trem­bling.

‘It’s us,’ Har­ry hissed. ‘We’re wear­ing the In­vis­ibil­ity Cloak. Let us in and we can take it off.’

‘Yeh shouldn’ve come!’ Ha­grid whis­pered, but he stood back, and they stepped in­side. Ha­grid shut the door quick­ly and Har­ry pulled off the Cloak.

Ha­grid was not cry­ing, nor did he throw him­self up­on their necks. He looked like a man who did not know where he was or what to do. This help­less­ness was worse to watch than tears.

‘Wan’ some tea?’ he said. His great hands were shak­ing as he reached for the ket­tle.

‘Where’s Buck­beak, Ha­grid?’ said Hermione hes­itant­ly.

‘I – I took him out­side,’ said Ha­grid, spilling milk all over the ta­ble as he filled up the jug. ‘He’s teth­ered in me pump­kin patch. Thought he ough­ta see the trees an’ – an’ smell fresh air – be­fore –’

Ha­grid’s hand trem­bled so vi­olent­ly that the milk jug slipped from his grasp and shat­tered all over the floor.

‘I’ll do it, Ha­grid,’ said Hermione quick­ly, hur­ry­ing over and start­ing to clean up the mess.

‘There’s an­oth­er one in the cup­board,’ Ha­grid said, sit­ting down and wip­ing his fore­head on his sleeve. Har­ry glanced at Ron, who looked back hope­less­ly.

‘Isn’t there any­thing any­one can do, Ha­grid?’ Har­ry asked fierce­ly, sit­ting down next to him. ‘Dum­ble­dore –’

‘He’s tried,’ said Ha­grid. ‘He’s got no pow­er ter over­rule the Com­mit­tee. He told ’em Buck­beak’s all right, but they’re scared … yeh know what Lu­cius Mal­foy’s like … threat­ened ’em, I ex­pect … an’ the ex­ecu­tion­er, Mac­nair, he’s an old pal o’ Mal­foy’s … but it’ll be quick an’ clean … an’ I’ll be be­side him …’

Ha­grid swal­lowed. His eyes were dart­ing all over the cab­in, as though look­ing for some shred of hope or com­fort.

‘Dum­ble­dore’s gonna come down while it – while it hap­pens. Wrote me this mornin’. Said he wants ter – ter be with me. Great man, Dum­ble­dore …’

Hermione, who had been rum­mag­ing in Ha­grid’s cup­board for an­oth­er milk jug, let out a small, quick­ly sti­fled sob. She straight­ened up with the new jug in her hands, fight­ing back tears.

‘We’ll stay with you, too, Ha­grid,’ she be­gan, but Ha­grid shook his shag­gy head.

‘Yeh’re ter go back up ter the cas­tle. I told yeh, I don’ wan’ yeh watchin’. An’ yeh shouldn’ be down here any­way … if Fudge an’ Dum­ble­dore catch yeh out with­out per­mis­sion, Har­ry, yeh’ll be in big trou­ble.’

Silent tears were now stream­ing down Hermione’s face, but she hid them from Ha­grid, bustling around mak­ing tea. Then, as she picked up the milk bot­tle to pour some in­to the jug, she let out a shriek.

‘Ron! I – I don’t be­lieve it – it’s Scab­bers!’

Ron gaped at her.

‘What are you talk­ing about?’

Hermione car­ried the milk jug over to the ta­ble and turned it up­side-​down. With a fran­tic squeak, and much scram­bling to get back in­side, Scab­bers the rat came slid­ing out on­to the ta­ble.

‘Scab­bers!’ said Ron blankly. ‘Scab­bers, what are you do­ing here?’

He grabbed the strug­gling rat and held him up to the light. Scab­bers looked dread­ful. He was thin­ner than ev­er, large tufts of hair had fall­en out leav­ing wide bald patch­es, and he writhed in Ron’s hands as though des­per­ate to free him­self.

‘It’s OK, Scab­bers!’ said Ron. ‘No cats! There’s noth­ing here to hurt you!’

Ha­grid sud­den­ly stood up, his eyes fixed on the win­dow. His nor­mal­ly rud­dy face had gone the colour of parch­ment.

‘They’re comin’ …’

Har­ry, Ron and Hermione whipped around. A group of men was walk­ing down the dis­tant cas­tle steps. In front was Al­bus Dum­ble­dore, his sil­ver beard gleam­ing in the dy­ing sun. Next to him trot­ted Cor­nelius Fudge. Be­hind them came the fee­ble old Com­mit­tee mem­ber and the ex­ecu­tion­er, Mac­nair.

‘Yeh got­ta go,’ said Ha­grid. Ev­ery inch of him was trem­bling. ‘They mustn’ find yeh here … go on, now …’

Ron stuffed Scab­bers in­to his pock­et and Hermione picked up the Cloak.

‘I’ll let yeh out the back way,’ said Ha­grid.

They fol­lowed him to the door in­to his back gar­den. Har­ry felt strange­ly un­re­al, and even more so when he saw Buck­beak a few yards away, teth­ered to a tree be­hind Ha­grid’s pump­kin patch. Buck­beak seemed to know some­thing was hap­pen­ing. He turned his sharp head from side to side, and pawed the ground ner­vous­ly.

‘It’s OK, Beaky,’ said Ha­grid soft­ly. ‘It’s OK …’ He turned to Har­ry, Ron and Hermione. ‘Go on,’ he said. ‘Get go­ing!’

But they didn’t move.

‘Ha­grid, we can’t –’

‘We’ll tell them what re­al­ly hap­pened –’

‘They can’t kill him –’

‘Go!’ said Ha­grid fierce­ly. ‘It’s bad enough with­out you lot in trou­ble an’ all!’

They had no choice. As Hermione threw the Cloak over Har­ry and Ron, they heard voic­es at the front of the cab­in. Ha­grid looked at the place where they had just van­ished from sight.

‘Go quick,’ he said hoarse­ly. ‘Don’ lis­ten …’

And he strode back in­to his cab­in as some­one knocked at the front door.

Slow­ly, in a kind of hor­ri­fied trance, Har­ry, Ron and Hermione set off silent­ly around Ha­grid’s house. As they reached the oth­er side, the front door closed with a sharp snap.

‘Please, let’s hur­ry,’ Hermione whis­pered. ‘I can’t stand it, I can’t bear it …’

They start­ed up the slop­ing lawn to­wards the cas­tle. The sun was sink­ing fast now; the sky had turned to a clear, pur­ple-​tinged grey, but to the west there was a ru­by-​red glow.

Ron stopped dead.

‘Oh, please, Ron,’ Hermione be­gan.

‘It’s Scab­bers – he won’t – stay put –’

Ron was bent over, try­ing to keep Scab­bers in his pock­et, but the rat was go­ing berserk; squeak­ing mad­ly, twist­ing and flail­ing, try­ing to sink his teeth in­to Ron’s hand.

‘Scab­bers, it’s me, you id­iot, it’s Ron,’ Ron hissed.

They heard a door open be­hind them and men’s voic­es.

‘Oh Ron, please let’s move, they’re go­ing to do it!’ Hermione breathed.

‘OK – Scab­bers, stay put –’

They walked for­wards; Har­ry, like Hermione, was try­ing not to lis­ten to the rum­ble of voic­es be­hind them. Ron stopped again.

‘I can’t hold him – Scab­bers, shut up, ev­ery­one’ll hear us –’

The rat was squeal­ing wild­ly, but not loud­ly enough to cov­er up the sounds drift­ing from Ha­grid’s gar­den. There was a jum­ble of in­dis­tinct male voic­es, a si­lence and then, with­out warn­ing, the un­mis­take­able swish and thud of an axe.

Hermione swayed on the spot.

‘They did it!’ she whis­pered to Har­ry. ‘I d-​don’t be­lieve it – they did it!’
