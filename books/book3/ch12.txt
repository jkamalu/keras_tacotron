CHAPTER TWELVE


The Pa­tronus



Har­ry knew that Hermione had meant well, but that didn’t stop him be­ing an­gry with her. He had been the own­er of the best broom in the world for a few short hours, and now, be­cause of her in­ter­fer­ence, he didn’t know whether he would ev­er see it again. He was pos­itive that there was noth­ing wrong with the Fire­bolt now, but what sort of state would it be in once it had been sub­ject­ed to all sorts of an­ti-​jinx tests?

Ron was fu­ri­ous with Hermione, too. As far as he was con­cerned, the strip­ping-​down of a brand-​new Fire­bolt was noth­ing less than crim­inal dam­age. Hermione, who re­mained con­vinced that she had act­ed for the best, start­ed avoid­ing the com­mon room. Har­ry and Ron sup­posed she had tak­en refuge in the li­brary, and didn’t try and per­suade her to come back. All in all, they were glad when the rest of the school re­turned short­ly af­ter New Year, and Gryffind­or Tow­er be­came crowd­ed and noisy again.

Wood sought Har­ry out on the night be­fore term start­ed.

‘Had a good Christ­mas?’ he said, and then, with­out wait­ing for an an­swer, he sat down, low­ered his voice and said, ‘I’ve been do­ing some think­ing over Christ­mas, Har­ry. Af­ter last match, you know. If the De­men­tors come to the next one … I mean … we can’t af­ford you to – well –’

Wood broke off, look­ing awk­ward.

‘I’m work­ing on it,’ said Har­ry quick­ly. ‘Pro­fes­sor Lupin said he’d train me to ward the De­men­tors off. We should be start­ing this week; he said he’d have time af­ter Christ­mas.’

‘Ah,’ said Wood, his ex­pres­sion clear­ing. ‘Well, in that case – I re­al­ly didn’t want to lose you as Seek­er, Har­ry. And have you or­dered a new broom yet?’

‘No,’ said Har­ry.

‘What! You’d bet­ter get a move on, you know – you can’t ride that Shoot­ing Star against Raven­claw!’

‘He got a Fire­bolt for Christ­mas,’ said Ron.

‘A Fire­bolt? No! Se­ri­ous­ly? A – a re­al Fire­bolt?’

‘Don’t get ex­cit­ed, Oliv­er,’ said Har­ry gloomi­ly. ‘I haven’t got it any more. It was con­fis­cat­ed.’ And he ex­plained all about how the Fire­bolt was now be­ing checked for jinx­es.

‘Jinxed? How could it be jinxed?’

‘Sir­ius Black,’ Har­ry said weari­ly. ‘He’s sup­posed to be af­ter me. So McG­ona­gall reck­ons he might have sent it.’

Wav­ing aside the in­for­ma­tion that a fa­mous mur­der­er was af­ter his Seek­er, Wood said, ‘But Black couldn’t have bought a Fire­bolt! He’s on the run! The whole coun­try’s on the look­out for him! How could he just walk in­to Qual­ity Quid­ditch Sup­plies and buy a broom­stick?’

‘I know,’ said Har­ry, ‘but McG­ona­gall still wants to strip it down –’

Wood went pale.

‘I’ll go and talk to her, Har­ry,’ he promised. ‘I’ll make her see rea­son … a Fire­bolt … a re­al Fire­bolt, on our team … she wants Gryffind­or to win as much as we do … I’ll make her see sense … a Fire­bolt …’

*

Lessons start­ed again next day. The last thing any­one felt like do­ing was spend­ing two hours in the grounds on a raw, Jan­uary morn­ing, but Ha­grid had pro­vid­ed a bon­fire full of sala­man­ders for their en­joy­ment, and they spent an un­usu­al­ly good les­son col­lect­ing dry wood and leaves to keep the fire blaz­ing, while the flame-​lov­ing lizards scam­pered up and down the crum­bling, white-​hot logs. The first Div­ina­tion les­son of the new term was much less fun; Pro­fes­sor Trelawney was now teach­ing them palm­istry, and she lost no time in in­form­ing Har­ry that he had the short­est life-​lines she had ev­er seen.

It was De­fence Against the Dark Arts that Har­ry was keen to get to; af­ter his con­ver­sa­tion with Wood, he want­ed to get start­ed on his An­ti-​De­men­tor lessons as soon as pos­si­ble.

‘Ah yes,’ said Lupin, when Har­ry re­mind­ed him of his promise at the end of class. ‘Let me see … how about eight o’clock on Thurs­day evening? The His­to­ry of Mag­ic class­room should be large enough … I’ll have to think care­ful­ly about how we’re go­ing to do this … we can’t bring a re­al De­men­tor in­to the cas­tle to prac­tise on …’

‘Still looks ill, doesn’t he?’ said Ron, as they walked down the cor­ri­dor, head­ing to din­ner. ‘What d’you reck­on’s the mat­ter with him?’

There was a loud and im­pa­tient ‘tuh’ from be­hind them. It was Hermione, who had been sit­ting at the feet of a suit of ar­mour, repack­ing her bag, which was so full of books it wouldn’t close.

‘And what are you tut­ting at us for?’ said Ron ir­ri­ta­bly.

‘Noth­ing,’ said Hermione in a lofty voice, heav­ing her bag back over her shoul­der.

‘Yes, you were,’ said Ron. ‘I said I won­der what’s wrong with Lupin, and you –’

‘Well, isn’t it ob­vi­ous?’ said Hermione, with a look of mad­den­ing su­pe­ri­or­ity.

‘If you don’t want to tell us, don’t,’ snapped Ron.

‘Fine,’ said Hermione haugh­ti­ly, and she marched off.

‘She doesn’t know,’ said Ron, star­ing re­sent­ful­ly af­ter Hermione.

‘She’s just try­ing to get us to talk to her again.’

*

At eight o’clock on Thurs­day evening, Har­ry left Gryffind­or Tow­er for the His­to­ry of Mag­ic class­room. It was dark and emp­ty when he ar­rived, but he lit the lamps with his wand and had wait­ed on­ly five min­utes when Pro­fes­sor Lupin turned up, car­ry­ing a large pack­ing case, which he heaved on­to Pro­fes­sor Binn’s desk.

‘What’s that?’ said Har­ry.

‘An­oth­er Bog­gart,’ said Lupin, strip­ping off his cloak. ‘I’ve been comb­ing the cas­tle ev­er since Tues­day, and very luck­ily, I found this one lurk­ing in­side Mr Filch’s fil­ing cab­inet. It’s the near­est we’ll get to a re­al De­men­tor. The Bog­gart will turn in­to a De­men­tor when he sees you, so we’ll be able to prac­tise on him. I can store him in my of­fice when we’re not us­ing him; there’s a cup­board un­der my desk he’ll like.’

‘OK,’ said Har­ry, try­ing to sound as though he wasn’t ap­pre­hen­sive at all and mere­ly glad that Lupin had found such a good sub­sti­tute for a re­al De­men­tor.

‘So …’ Pro­fes­sor Lupin had tak­en out his own wand, and in­di­cat­ed that Har­ry should do the same. ‘The spell I am go­ing to try and teach you is high­ly ad­vanced mag­ic, Har­ry – well be­yond Or­di­nary Wiz­ard­ing Lev­el. It is called the Pa­tronus Charm.’

‘How does it work?’ said Har­ry ner­vous­ly.

‘Well, when it works cor­rect­ly, it con­jures up a Pa­tronus,’ said Lupin, ‘which is a kind of An­ti-​De­men­tor – a guardian which acts as a shield be­tween you and the De­men­tor.’

Har­ry had a sud­den vi­sion of him­self crouch­ing be­hind a Ha­grid-​sized fig­ure hold­ing a large club. Pro­fes­sor Lupin con­tin­ued, ‘The Pa­tronus is a kind of pos­itive force, a pro­jec­tion of the very things that the De­men­tor feeds up­on – hope, hap­pi­ness, the de­sire to sur­vive – but it can­not feel de­spair, as re­al hu­mans can, so the De­men­tors can’t hurt it. But I must warn you, Har­ry, that the Charm might be too ad­vanced for you. Many qual­ified wiz­ards have dif­fi­cul­ty with it.’

‘What does a Pa­tronus look like?’ said Har­ry cu­ri­ous­ly.

‘Each one is unique to the wiz­ard who con­jures it.’

‘And how do you con­jure it?’

‘With an in­can­ta­tion, which will work on­ly if you are con­cen­trat­ing, with all your might, on a sin­gle, very hap­py mem­ory.’

Har­ry cast about for a hap­py mem­ory. Cer­tain­ly, noth­ing that had hap­pened to him at the Durs­leys’ was go­ing to do. Fi­nal­ly, he set­tled on the mo­ment when he had first rid­den a broom­stick.

‘Right,’ he said, try­ing to re­call as ex­act­ly as pos­si­ble the won­der­ful, soar­ing sen­sa­tion in his stom­ach.

‘The in­can­ta­tion is this –’ Lupin cleared his throat, ‘ex­pec­to pa­tron­um!’

‘Ex­pec­to pa­tron­um,’ Har­ry re­peat­ed un­der his breath, ‘ex­pec­to pa­tron­um.’

‘Con­cen­trat­ing hard on your hap­py mem­ory?’

‘Oh – yeah –’ said Har­ry, quick­ly forc­ing his thoughts back to that first broom-​ride. ‘Ex­pec­to pa­trono – no, pa­tron­um – sor­ry – ex­pec­to pa­tron­um, ex­pec­to pa­tron­um –’

Some­thing whooshed sud­den­ly out of the end of his wand; it looked like a wisp of sil­very gas.

‘Did you see that?’ said Har­ry ex­cit­ed­ly. ‘Some­thing hap­pened!’

‘Very good,’ said Lupin, smil­ing. ‘Right then – ready to try it on a De­men­tor?’

‘Yes,’ Har­ry said, grip­ping his wand very tight­ly, and mov­ing in­to the mid­dle of the de­sert­ed class­room. He tried to keep his mind on fly­ing, but some­thing else kept in­trud­ing … any sec­ond now, he might hear his moth­er again … but he shouldn’t think that, or he would hear her again, and he didn’t want to … or did he?

Lupin grasped the lid of the pack­ing case and pulled.

A De­men­tor rose slow­ly from the box, its hood­ed face turned to­wards Har­ry, one glis­ten­ing, scabbed hand grip­ping its cloak. The lamps around the class­room flick­ered and went out. The De­men­tor stepped from the box and start­ed to sweep silent­ly to­wards Har­ry, draw­ing a deep, rat­tling breath. A wave of pierc­ing cold broke over him –

‘Ex­pec­to pa­tron­um!’ Har­ry yelled. ‘Ex­pec­to pa­tron­um! Ex­pec­to –’

But the class­room and the De­men­tor were dis­solv­ing … Har­ry was falling again through thick white fog, and his moth­er’s voice was loud­er than ev­er, echo­ing in­side his head – ‘Not Har­ry! Not Har­ry! Please – I’ll do any­thing –’

‘Stand aside – stand aside, girl –’

‘Har­ry!’

Har­ry jerked back to life. He was ly­ing flat on his back on the floor. The class­room lamps were alight again. He didn’t have to ask what had hap­pened.

‘Sor­ry,’ he mut­tered, sit­ting up and feel­ing cold sweat trick­ling down be­hind his glass­es.

‘Are you all right?’ said Lupin.

‘Yes …’ Har­ry pulled him­self up on one of the desks and leaned against it.

‘Here –’ Lupin hand­ed him a Choco­late Frog. ‘Eat this be­fore we try again. I didn’t ex­pect you to do it first time. In fact, I would have been as­tound­ed if you had.’

‘It’s get­ting worse,’ Har­ry mut­tered, bit­ing the Frog’s head off. ‘I could hear her loud­er that time – and him – Volde­mort –’

Lupin looked paler than usu­al.

‘Har­ry if you don’t want to con­tin­ue, I will more than un­der­stand –’

‘I do!’ said Har­ry fierce­ly, stuff­ing the rest of the Choco­late Frog in­to his mouth. ‘I’ve got to! What if the De­men­tors turn up at our match against Raven­claw? I can’t af­ford to fall off again. If we lose this game we’ve lost the Quid­ditch Cup!’

‘All right then …’ said Lupin. ‘You might want to se­lect an­oth­er mem­ory, a hap­py mem­ory, I mean, to con­cen­trate on … that one doesn’t seem to have been strong enough …’

Har­ry thought hard, and de­cid­ed his feel­ings when Gryffind­or had won the House Cham­pi­onship last year had def­inite­ly qual­ified as very hap­py. He gripped his wand tight­ly again, and took up his po­si­tion in the mid­dle of the class­room.

‘Ready?’ said Lupin, grip­ping the box lid.

‘Ready’ said Har­ry, try­ing hard to fill his head with hap­py thoughts about Gryffind­or win­ning, and not dark thoughts about what was go­ing to hap­pen when the box opened.

‘Go!’ said Lupin, pulling off the lid. The room went ici­ly cold and dark once more. The De­men­tor glid­ed for­wards, draw­ing its rat­tly breath; one rot­ting hand was ex­tend­ing to­wards Har­ry –

‘Ex­pec­to pa­tron­um!’ Har­ry yelled. ‘Ex­pec­to pa­tron­um! Ex­pec­to pat –’

White fog ob­scured his sens­es … big, blurred shapes were mov­ing around him … then came a new voice, a man’s voice, shout­ing, pan­ick­ing –

‘Lily, take Har­ry and go! It’s Him! Go! Run! I’ll hold him off –’

The sounds of some­one stum­bling from a room – a door burst­ing open – a cack­le of high-​pitched laugh­ter –

‘Har­ry! Har­ry … wake up …’

Lupin was tap­ping Har­ry hard on the face. This time it was a minute be­fore Har­ry un­der­stood why he was ly­ing on a dusty class­room floor.

‘I heard my dad,’ Har­ry mum­bled. ‘That’s the first time I’ve ev­er heard him – he tried to take on Volde­mort him­self, to give my mum time to run for it …’

Har­ry sud­den­ly re­alised that there were tears on his face min­gling with the sweat. He bent his face low as pos­si­ble, wip­ing them off on his robes, pre­tend­ing to do up his shoelace, so that Lupin wouldn’t see.

‘You heard James?’ said Lupin, in a strange voice.

‘Yeah …’ Face dry, Har­ry looked up. ‘Why – you didn’t know my dad, did you?’

‘I – I did, as a mat­ter of fact,’ said Lupin. ‘We were friends at Hog­warts. Lis­ten, Har­ry – per­haps we should leave it here for tonight. This charm is ridicu­lous­ly ad­vanced … I shouldn’t have sug­gest­ed putting you through this …’

‘No!’ said Har­ry. He got up again. ‘I’ll have one more go! I’m not think­ing of hap­py enough things, that’s what it is … hang on …’

He racked his brains. A re­al­ly, re­al­ly hap­py mem­ory … one that he could turn in­to a good, strong Pa­tronus …

The mo­ment when he’d first found out he was a wiz­ard, and would be leav­ing the Durs­leys for Hog­warts! If that wasn’t a hap­py mem­ory, he didn’t know what was … con­cen­trat­ing very hard on how he had felt when he’d re­alised he’d be leav­ing Priv­et Drive, Har­ry got to his feet and faced the pack­ing case once more.

‘Ready?’ said Lupin, who looked as though he was do­ing this against his bet­ter judge­ment. ‘Con­cen­trat­ing hard? All right – go!’

He pulled off the lid of the case for the third time, and the De­men­tor rose out of it; the room fell cold and dark –

‘EX­PEC­TO PA­TRON­UM!’ Har­ry bel­lowed. ‘EX­PEC­TO PA­TRON­UM! EX­PEC­TO PA­TRON­UM!’

The scream­ing in­side Har­ry’s head had start­ed again – ex­cept this time, it sound­ed as though it was com­ing from a bad­ly tuned ra­dio. Soft­er and loud­er and soft­er again … and he could still see the De­men­tor … it had halt­ed … and then a huge, sil­ver shad­ow came burst­ing out of the end of Har­ry’s wand, to hov­er be­tween him and the De­men­tor, and though Har­ry’s legs felt like wa­ter, he was still on his feet … though for how much longer, he wasn’t sure …

‘Rid­diku­lus!’ roared Lupin, spring­ing for­wards.

There was a loud crack, and Har­ry’s cloudy Pa­tronus van­ished along with the De­men­tor; he sank in­to a chair, feel­ing as ex­haust­ed as if he’d just run a mile, his legs shak­ing. Out of the cor­ner of his eye, he saw Pro­fes­sor Lupin forc­ing the Bog­gart back in­to the pack­ing case with his wand; it had turned in­to a sil­very orb again.

‘Ex­cel­lent!’ Lupin said, strid­ing over to where Har­ry sat. ‘Ex­cel­lent, Har­ry! That was def­inite­ly a start!’

‘Can we have an­oth­er go? Just one more go?’

‘Not now,’ said Lupin firm­ly. ‘You’ve had enough for one night. Here –’

He hand­ed Har­ry a large bar of Hon­ey­dukes’ best choco­late.

‘Eat the lot, or Madam Pom­frey will be af­ter my blood. Same time next week?’

‘OK,’ said Har­ry. He took a bite of the choco­late and watched Lupin ex­tin­guish­ing the lamps that had rekin­dled with the dis­ap­pear­ance of the De­men­tor. A thought had just oc­curred to him.

‘Pro­fes­sor Lupin?’ he said. ‘If you knew my dad, you must’ve known Sir­ius Black as well.’

Lupin turned very quick­ly.

‘What gives you that idea?’ he said sharply.

‘Noth­ing – I mean, I just knew they were friends at Hog­warts, too …’

Lupin’s face re­laxed.

‘Yes, I knew him,’ he said short­ly. ‘Or I thought I did. You’d bet­ter get off, Har­ry, it’s get­ting late.’

Har­ry left the class­room, walked along the cor­ri­dor and around a cor­ner, than took a de­tour be­hind a suit of ar­mour and sank down on its plinth to fin­ish his choco­late, wish­ing he hadn’t men­tioned Black, as Lupin was ob­vi­ous­ly not keen on the sub­ject. Then Har­ry’s thoughts wan­dered back to his moth­er and fa­ther …

He felt drained and strange­ly emp­ty, even though he was so full of choco­late. Ter­ri­ble though it was to hear his par­ents’ last mo­ments re­played in­side his head, these were the on­ly times Har­ry had heard their voic­es since he was a very small child. But he’d nev­er be able to pro­duce a prop­er Pa­tronus if he half-​want­ed to hear his par­ents again …

‘They’re dead,’ he told him­self stern­ly. ‘They’re dead, and lis­ten­ing to echoes of them won’t bring them back. You’d bet­ter get a grip on your­self if you want that Quid­ditch Cup.’

He stood up, crammed the last bit of choco­late in­to his mouth and head­ed back to Gryffind­or Tow­er.

*

Raven­claw played Slytherin a week af­ter the start of term. Slytherin won, though nar­row­ly. Ac­cord­ing to Wood, this was good news for Gryffind­or, who would take sec­ond place if they beat Raven­claw too. He there­fore in­creased the num­ber of team prac­tices to five a week. This meant that with Lupin’s An­ti-​De­men­tor class­es, which in them­selves were more drain­ing than six Quid­ditch prac­tices, Har­ry had just one night a week to do all his home­work. Even so, he wasn’t show­ing the strain near­ly as much as Hermione, whose im­mense work­load fi­nal­ly seemed to be get­ting to her. Ev­ery night, with­out fail, Hermione was to be seen in a cor­ner of the com­mon room, sev­er­al ta­bles spread with books, Arith­man­cy charts, Rune dic­tio­nar­ies, di­agrams of Mug­gles lift­ing heavy ob­jects, and file up­on file of ex­ten­sive notes; she bare­ly spoke to any­body, and snapped when she was in­ter­rupt­ed.

‘How’s she do­ing it?’ Ron mut­tered to Har­ry one evening, as Har­ry sat fin­ish­ing a nasty es­say on Un­de­tectable Poi­sons for Snape. Har­ry looked up. Hermione was bare­ly vis­ible be­hind a tot­ter­ing pile of books.

‘Do­ing what?’

‘Get­ting to all her class­es!’ Ron said. ‘I heard her talk­ing to Pro­fes­sor Vec­tor, that Arith­man­cy witch, this morn­ing. They were go­ing on about yes­ter­day’s les­son, but Hermione can’t’ve been there, be­cause she was with us in Care of Mag­ical Crea­tures! And Ernie McMil­lan told me she’s nev­er missed a Mug­gle Stud­ies class, but half of them are at the same time as Div­ina­tion, and she’s nev­er missed one of them, ei­ther!’

Har­ry didn’t have time to fath­om the mys­tery of Hermione’s im­pos­si­ble timetable at the mo­ment; he re­al­ly need­ed to get on with Snape’s es­say. Two sec­onds lat­er, how­ev­er, he was in­ter­rupt­ed again, this time by Wood.

‘Bad news, Har­ry. I’ve just been to see Pro­fes­sor McG­ona­gall about the Fire­bolt. She – er – got a bit shir­ty with me. Told me I’d got my pri­or­ities wrong. Seemed to think I cared more about win­ning the Cup than I do about you stay­ing alive. Just be­cause I told her I didn’t care if it threw you off, as long as you caught the Snitch on it first.’ Wood shook his head in dis­be­lief. ‘Hon­est­ly, the way she was yelling at me … you’d think I’d said some­thing ter­ri­ble. Then I asked her how much longer she was go­ing to keep it …’ He screwed up his face and im­itat­ed Pro­fes­sor McG­ona­gall’s se­vere voice, ‘‘As long as nec­es­sary, Wood’ … I reck­on it’s time you or­dered a new broom, Har­ry. There’s an or­der form at the back of Which Broom­stick … you could get a Nim­bus Two Thou­sand and One, like Mal­foy’s got.’

‘I’m not buy­ing any­thing Mal­foy thinks is good,’ said Har­ry flat­ly.

*

Jan­uary fad­ed im­per­cep­ti­bly in­to Febru­ary, with no change in the bit­ter­ly cold weath­er. The match against Raven­claw was draw­ing near­er and near­er, but Har­ry still hadn’t or­dered a new broom. He was now ask­ing Pro­fes­sor McG­ona­gall for news of the Fire­bolt af­ter ev­ery Trans­fig­ura­tion les­son, Ron stand­ing hope­ful­ly at his shoul­der, Hermione rush­ing past with her face avert­ed.

‘No, Pot­ter, you can’t have it back yet,’ Pro­fes­sor McG­ona­gall told him the twelfth time this hap­pened, be­fore he’d even opened his mouth. ‘We’ve checked for most of the usu­al curs­es, but Pro­fes­sor Flitwick be­lieves the broom might be car­ry­ing a Hurl­ing Hex. I shall tell you once we’ve fin­ished check­ing it. Now, please stop bad­ger­ing me.’

To make mat­ters even worse, Har­ry’s An­ti-​De­men­tor lessons were not go­ing near­ly as well as he had hoped. Sev­er­al ses­sions on, he was able to pro­duce an in­dis­tinct, sil­very shad­ow ev­ery time the Bog­gart-​De­men­tor ap­proached him, but his Pa­tronus was too fee­ble to drive the De­men­tor away. All it did was hov­er, like a se­mi-​trans­par­ent cloud, drain­ing Har­ry of en­er­gy as he fought to keep it there. Har­ry felt an­gry with him­self, guilty about his se­cret de­sire to hear his par­ents’ voic­es again.

‘You’re ex­pect­ing too much of your­self,’ said Pro­fes­sor Lupin stern­ly, in their fourth week of prac­tice. ‘For a thir­teen-​year-​old wiz­ard, even an in­dis­tinct Pa­tronus is a huge achieve­ment. You aren’t pass­ing out any more, are you?’

‘I thought a Pa­tronus would – charge the De­men­tors down or some­thing,’ said Har­ry dispirit­ed­ly. ‘Make them dis­ap­pear –’

‘The true Pa­tronus does do that,’ said Lupin. ‘But you’ve achieved a great deal in a very short space of time. If the De­men­tors put in an ap­pear­ance at your next Quid­ditch match, you will be able to keep them at bay long enough to get back to the ground.’

‘You said it’s hard­er if there are loads of them,’ said Har­ry.

‘I have com­plete con­fi­dence in you,’ said Lupin, smil­ing. ‘Here – you’ve earned a drink. Some­thing from the Three Broom­sticks, you won’t have tried it be­fore –’

He pulled two bot­tles out of his brief­case.

‘But­ter­beer!’ said Har­ry, with­out think­ing. ‘Yeah, I like that stuff!’

Lupin raised an eye­brow.

‘Oh – Ron and Hermione brought me some back from Hogsmeade,’ Har­ry lied quick­ly.

‘I see,’ said Lupin, though he still looked slight­ly sus­pi­cious. ‘Well – let’s drink to a Gryffind­or vic­to­ry against Raven­claw! Not that I’m sup­posed to take sides, as a teach­er …’ he added hasti­ly.

They drank the But­ter­beer in si­lence, un­til Har­ry voiced some­thing he’d been won­der­ing for a while.

‘What’s un­der a De­men­tor’s hood?’

Pro­fes­sor Lupin low­ered his bot­tle thought­ful­ly.

‘Hm­mm … well, the on­ly peo­ple who re­al­ly know are in no con­di­tion to tell us. You see, the De­men­tor on­ly low­ers its hood to use its last and worst weapon.’

‘What’s that?’

‘They call it the De­men­tors’ Kiss,’ said Lupin, with a slight­ly twist­ed smile. ‘It’s what De­men­tors do to those they wish to de­stroy ut­ter­ly. I sup­pose there must be some kind of mouth un­der there, be­cause they clamp their jaws up­on the mouth of the vic­tim and – and suck out his soul.’

Har­ry ac­ci­den­tal­ly spat out a bit of But­ter­beer.

‘What – they kill –?’

‘Oh, no,’ said Lupin. ‘Much worse than that. You can ex­ist with­out your soul, you know, as long as your brain and heart are still work­ing. But you’ll have no sense of self any more, no mem­ory, no … any­thing. There’s no chance at all of re­cov­ery. You’ll just – ex­ist. As an emp­ty shell. And your soul is gone for ev­er … lost.’

Lupin drank a lit­tle more But­ter­beer, then said, ‘It’s the fate that awaits Sir­ius Black. It was in the Dai­ly Prophet this morn­ing. The Min­istry have giv­en the De­men­tors per­mis­sion to per­form it if they find him.’

Har­ry sat stunned for a mo­ment at the idea of some­one hav­ing their soul sucked out through their mouth. But then he thought of Black.

‘He de­serves it,’ he said sud­den­ly.

‘You think so?’ said Lupin light­ly. ‘Do you re­al­ly think any­one de­serves that?’

‘Yes,’ said Har­ry de­fi­ant­ly. ‘For … for some things …’

He would have liked to have told Lupin about the con­ver­sa­tion he’d over­heard about Black in the Three Broom­sticks, about Black be­tray­ing his moth­er and fa­ther, but it would have in­volved re­veal­ing that he’d gone to Hogsmeade with­out per­mis­sion, and he knew Lupin wouldn’t be very im­pressed by that. So he fin­ished his But­ter­beer, thanked Lupin, and left the His­to­ry of Mag­ic class­room.

Har­ry half-​wished that he hadn’t asked what was un­der a De­men­tor’s hood, the an­swer had been so hor­ri­ble, and he was so lost in un­pleas­ant thoughts of what it would feel like to have your soul sucked out of you, that he walked head­long in­to Pro­fes­sor McG­ona­gall halfway up the stairs.

‘Do watch where you’re go­ing, Pot­ter!’

‘Sor­ry, Pro­fes­sor –’

‘I’ve just been look­ing for you in the Gryffind­or com­mon room. Well, here it is, we’ve done ev­ery­thing we could think of, and there doesn’t seem to be any­thing wrong with it at all – you’ve got a very good friend some­where, Pot­ter …’

Har­ry’s jaw dropped. She was hold­ing out his Fire­bolt, and it looked as mag­nif­icent as ev­er.

‘I can have it back?’ Har­ry said weak­ly. ‘Se­ri­ous­ly?’

‘Se­ri­ous­ly,’ said Pro­fes­sor McG­ona­gall, and she was ac­tu­al­ly smil­ing. ‘I dare­say you’ll need to get the feel of it be­fore Sat­ur­day’s match, won’t you? And Pot­ter – do try and win, won’t you? Or we’ll be out of the run­ning for the eighth year in a row, as Pro­fes­sor Snape was kind enough to re­mind me on­ly last night …’

Speech­less, Har­ry car­ried the Fire­bolt back up­stairs to­wards Gryffind­or Tow­er. As he turned a cor­ner, he saw Ron dash­ing to­wards him, grin­ning from ear to ear.

‘She gave it to you? Ex­cel­lent! Lis­ten, can I still have a go on it? To­mor­row?’

‘Yeah … any­thing …’ said Har­ry, his heart lighter than it had been in a month. ‘You know what – we should make it up with Hermione. She was on­ly try­ing to help …’

‘Yeah, all right,’ said Ron. ‘She’s in the com­mon room now – work­ing, for a change.’

They turned in­to the cor­ri­dor to Gryffind­or Tow­er and saw Neville Long­bot­tom, plead­ing with Sir Cado­gan, who seemed to be re­fus­ing him en­trance.

‘I wrote them down,’ Neville was say­ing tear­ful­ly, ‘but I must’ve dropped them some­where!’

‘A like­ly tale!’ roared Sir Cado­gan. Then, spot­ting Har­ry and Ron, ‘Good even, my fine young yeomen! Come clap this loon in irons, he is try­ing to force en­try to the cham­bers with­in!’

‘Oh, shut up,’ said Ron, as he and Har­ry drew lev­el with Neville.

‘I’ve lost the pass­words!’ Neville told them mis­er­ably. ‘I made him tell me what pass­words he was go­ing to use this week, be­cause he keeps chang­ing them, and now I don’t know what I’ve done with them!’

‘Odd­sbodikins,’ said Har­ry to Sir Cado­gan, who looked ex­treme­ly dis­ap­point­ed and re­luc­tant­ly swung for­wards to let them in­to the com­mon room. There was a sud­den, ex­cit­ed mur­mur as ev­ery head turned and the next mo­ment, Har­ry was sur­round­ed by peo­ple ex­claim­ing over his Fire­bolt.

‘Where’d you get it, Har­ry?’

‘Will you let me have a go?’

‘Have you rid­den it yet, Har­ry?’

‘Raven­claw’ll have no chance, they’re all on Clean­sweep Sev­ens!’

‘Can I just hold it, Har­ry?’

Af­ter ten min­utes or so, dur­ing which the Fire­bolt was passed around and ad­mired from ev­ery an­gle, the crowd dis­persed and Har­ry and Ron had a clear view of Hermione, the on­ly per­son who hadn’t rushed over to them, bent over her work, and care­ful­ly avoid­ing their eyes. Har­ry and Ron ap­proached her ta­ble and at last, she looked up.

‘I got it back,’ said Har­ry, grin­ning at her and hold­ing up the Fire­bolt.

‘See, Hermione? There wasn’t any­thing wrong with it!’ said Ron.

‘Well – there might have been!’ said Hermione. ‘I mean, at least you know now that it’s safe!’

‘Yeah, I sup­pose so,’ said Har­ry. ‘I’d bet­ter put it up­stairs –’

‘I’ll take it!’ said Ron ea­ger­ly. ‘I’ve got to give Scab­bers his Rat Ton­ic.’

He took the Fire­bolt, and, hold­ing it as if it were made of glass, car­ried it away up the boys’ stair­case.

‘Can I sit down, then?’ Har­ry asked Hermione.

‘I sup­pose so,’ said Hermione, mov­ing a great stack of parch­ment off a chair.

Har­ry looked around at the clut­tered ta­ble, at the long Arith­man­cy es­say on which the ink was still glis­ten­ing, at the even longer Mug­gle Stud­ies es­say (‘Ex­plain why Mug­gles Need Elec­tric­ity’) and at the Rune trans­la­tion Hermione was now por­ing over.

‘How are you get­ting through all this stuff?’ Har­ry asked her.

‘Oh, well – you know – work­ing hard,’ said Hermione. Close to, Har­ry saw that she looked al­most as tired as Lupin.

‘Why don’t you just drop a cou­ple of sub­jects?’ Har­ry asked, watch­ing her lift­ing books as she searched for her Rune dic­tio­nary.

‘I couldn’t do that!’ said Hermione, look­ing scan­dalised.

‘Arith­man­cy looks ter­ri­ble,’ said Har­ry, pick­ing up a very com­pli­cat­ed-​look­ing num­ber chart.

‘Oh, no, it’s won­der­ful!’ said Hermione earnest­ly. ‘It’s my favourite sub­ject! It’s –’

But ex­act­ly what was won­der­ful about Arith­man­cy, Har­ry nev­er found out. At that pre­cise mo­ment, a stran­gled yell echoed down the boys’ stair­case. The whole com­mon room fell silent, star­ing, pet­ri­fied, at the en­trance. There came hur­ried foot­steps, grow­ing loud­er and loud­er – and then, Ron came leap­ing in­to view, drag­ging with him a bed­sheet.

‘LOOK!’ he bel­lowed, strid­ing over to Hermione’s ta­ble. ‘LOOK!’ he yelled, shak­ing the sheets in her face.

‘Ron, what –?’

‘SCAB­BERS! LOOK! SCAB­BERS!’

Hermione was lean­ing away from Ron, look­ing ut­ter­ly be­wil­dered. Har­ry looked down at the sheet Ron was hold­ing. There was some­thing red on it. Some­thing that looked hor­ri­bly like –

‘BLOOD!’ Ron yelled in­to the stunned si­lence. ‘HE’S GONE! AND YOU KNOW WHAT WAS ON THE FLOOR?’

‘N-​no,’ said Hermione, in a trem­bling voice.

Ron threw some­thing down on­to Hermione’s Rune trans­la­tion. Hermione and Har­ry leaned for­ward. Ly­ing on top of the weird, spiky shapes were sev­er­al long, gin­ger cat hairs.
